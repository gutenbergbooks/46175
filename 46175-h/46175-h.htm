<p>In the meantime great events were occurring which
were in some respects more important in their bearing
on the war than battles would have been. In these
events the war recognized itself and adapted itself to
its conditions.</p>

<p>From the beginning the abolitionists had clamorously
and ceaselessly demanded of Mr. Lincoln that
he should recognize the actual cause of the war by
proclaiming freedom for the slaves at the South.
There was no doubt in anybody's mind that the war
was simply the culmination of that "irrepressible conflict"
between the systems and sentiments of free and
slave labor which had constituted the burden of the
country's history for nearly half a century. If there
had been no slavery there would have been no war.</p>

<p>It is true that a very large proportion of the Southern
people regretted slavery, deprecated its existence,
and earnestly desired to be rid of it. It is also true
that the great mass of the Southerners were non-slaveholders,
and that their fighting was done not for
the perpetuation of that institution, in which they had
no interest, but in assertion of those reserved rights of
the individual states upon the maintenance of which
they sincerely believed that the liberty of the people
depended. These people desired to take their states<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
out of the Union, not for the sake of slavery, but for
the sake of that right of local self-government which
they regarded as the fundamental condition of liberty
among men.</p>

<p>On the other hand a large proportion of the Northern
people cared little or nothing about slavery&mdash;many
of them even approving the institution as the
only practicable arrangement under which blacks and
whites could live peaceably together, and as a condition
eminently proper for the incapable black man.
But these believed in the maintenance of the Union
as a condition of liberty and progress, and were ready
to sacrifice their lives and their possessions in behalf
of that end.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it was clear from the beginning that
in the last analysis, the war involved as its issue the
maintenance of slavery, or the destruction of that
system root and branch.</p>

<p>Personally Mr. Lincoln hated slavery and very
earnestly desired its extermination. But, as he reminded
those who beset him with unsolicited advice,
he was restrained by his oath of office while they were
free to advocate any principle or policy that might
seem good in their eyes.</p>

<p>Moreover, he had upon him the tremendous task
of preserving the Union and in aid of that supreme
purpose he was ready to sacrifice all other considerations
of what kind soever. In answer to an impassioned
appeal from Horace Greeley in August, 1862,
Mr. Lincoln set forth his attitude in these words:</p>

<p>"My paramount object is to save the Union, and
not either to save or destroy slavery. If I could save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it.
If I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do
it. And if I could do it by freeing some and leaving
others alone, I would also do that."</p>

<p>At the beginning Mr. Lincoln had clearly seen the
necessity of winning all the support he could to his
war measures. He had seen that while practically the
whole population of the North would stand by him
in a war for the preservation of the Union, there must
be a very great and dangerous defection, should he
make the war one for the extirpation of slavery in
those states in which the institution existed under protection
of the Federal Constitution. By thus resolutely
refusing to make the war a crusade against
slavery, and declaring&mdash;as he did in his official utterances&mdash;that
it was no part of his purpose to interfere
with the domestic institutions of any state, Mr. Lincoln
had drawn to his support a vast body of influential
citizens who would otherwise have opposed, and
whose influence was great enough perhaps, if it had
been offended, to have robbed him of the means of
restoring the disrupted Union. Had he adopted the
policy of the extremists at the North, had he begun
by declaring war upon slavery rather than upon disunion,
there is little doubt that Maryland, Kentucky
and the whole strength of Missouri would have been
thrown into the Confederate side of the scale with disastrous
effect. Even New York, the financially and
otherwise dominant Northern state, would have given
him at best only a divided and ineffective allegiance,
while in all the other states of the North, heavy
minorities, and in some cases perhaps commanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
majorities, would have opposed his measures and deprived
him of that support in Congress and the country
upon which depended his success in his effort to
restore and perpetuate the Union.</p>

<p>By his policy of waging war at the outset only for
the salvation of the nation's integrity he won to his
measures the support of hundreds of thousands whose
antagonism, or whose dissatisfied inactivity, would
have threatened the National arms with defeat and
disaster. So far-reaching indeed was the effect of
his wiser policy that it gave to the country in its hour
of sorest need the services of the great War Minister,
Edwin M. Stanton, with all that his inclusion in the
cabinet implied.</p>

<p>Mr. Stanton and Mr. Lincoln were not friends.
They were very nearly enemies. Stanton was a
Democrat of very pronounced views; Mr. Lincoln
represented a party which Stanton had strongly and
even bitterly assailed, holding it to be sectional in
origin, impulse and purpose, and therefore scarcely
less than a treasonable conspiracy against the Nation.
But when Mr. Lincoln resolutely formulated his policy,
as one that had for its sole object the restoration
of the American Union of States and the preservation
of the Nation from disruption, Mr. Stanton gladly
consented to bear his share in the conduct of affairs
with that end in view.</p>

<p>It was a daring thing for Mr. Lincoln to do, thus
to place at the head of the War Department when
actual war was on, a Democrat whose Democracy was
everywhere known to be pronounced and aggressive.
Mr. Lincoln foresaw that such an appointment would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
inevitably invite hostile criticism and probably active
opposition. But Mr. Lincoln was a man of exalted
moral courage. He needed the peculiar abilities of
Edwin M. Stanton at the head of the War Department
at a time when the war seemed almost everywhere
to be going against the Union cause, and he
needed Stanton's influence in the country. He therefore
risked criticism and made the appointment as
one that would tend better than any other to marshal
the Federal strength into an effective force and perhaps
extort victory at the last from a situation which
had thus far brought mainly disappointment.</p>

<p>Perhaps the sagacity of the President had still another
object in view in the appointment of Stanton.
Mr. Lincoln was a shrewd and far-seeing politician.
By appointing Stanton, his personal enemy and a
distinguished Democrat, to the second most important
place among his Constitutional advisers, he did more
than in any other way he could have done, to reconcile
Northern Democrats to his administration and
to make of them earnest supporters instead of active
antagonists of his measures for the preservation of
the Union.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln had several opportunities to emphasize
his attitude and purpose. The best of these was
furnished by Horace Greeley's article, in reply to
which he wrote the passages already quoted in this
chapter.</p>

<p>But the matter was made more emphatic in other
ways. When McClellan, early in the war, advanced
into Western Virginia, that general issued a proclamation
to all slaveholders there assuring them that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
it was no part of the Government's purpose or policy
to interfere with the institution of slavery; that on
the contrary the Federal forces would promptly restore
to their masters any fugitive slaves who might
escape to the Union lines, and that the Federal armies
would themselves suppress every attempt at slave insurrection
which might be made in the interest of the
Union cause. "Notwithstanding all that has been
said by the traitors," he wrote, "to induce you to believe
our advent among you will be signalized by an
interference with your slaves, understand one thing
clearly; not only will we abstain from all such interference,
but we will, on the contrary, with an iron
hand crush any attempt at insurrection on their part."</p>

<p>There is not the smallest doubt that McClellan
issued this proclamation with Mr. Lincoln's full approval
and even probably by his direction. In any
case it reflected the President's attitude and purpose
at that time.</p>

<p>At an earlier date, in May, 1861, General B.&nbsp;F.
Butler, then commanding at Fortress Monroe, was
appealed to for the return of three fugitive slaves
who had escaped into his lines. He refused upon a
law point of great subtlety. He contended that as
negro slaves&mdash;chattels of their owners&mdash;were capable
of being made useful to the Confederates, not only
as producers of food for the support of the Southern
armies, but also as laborers upon the fortifications and
the like, they were properly "contraband of war" precisely
as arms and ammunition and foodstuffs are.
From that time forward an escaping slave was called
a "contraband," and in view of the astonishing lies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
told by such "contrabands," and the errors of judgment
into which those imaginary bits of information
often led the Northern press and people, there was
at last a general ridiculing of all statements based
upon the testimony of "intelligent contrabands."</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln did not interfere with General Butler's
policy of holding escaped slaves as merchandise "contraband
of war." But in other cases he did interfere
with the strong hand. In August, 1861, General
Fremont, commanding in Missouri, issued a proclamation
declaring free the slaves of every Confederate
engaged in war against the Union. Mr. Lincoln
repudiated the proclamation and himself abrogated
its terms.</p>

<p>Seven months later, in March, 1862, Mr. Lincoln
gravely asked Congress to adopt a policy of compensated
emancipation. The war had already cost
about a billion dollars, and it threatened to cost twice
or thrice that sum in addition, with an uncertain result
as the outcome.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Mr. Lincoln planned to end the
struggle by a business-like negotiation. He asked
Congress (March 6, 1862), to authorize the Government
to lend pecuniary aid to every state which
should adopt measures looking to the gradual abolition
of slavery. He saw and felt that it would be
cheaper for the Government to buy every slave in
the land at twice his market value, than to prosecute
the war upon the enormously costly scale which it
had assumed. Incidentally, also, the making of such
an arrangement, if it had been possible to make it,
would have saved the lives of hundreds of thousands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
of men&mdash;the flower of the country's youth on both
sides of the line.</p>

<p>It was a business-like and humane thought, and
Congress assented to it. But it was based upon the
mistaken notion that the Confederates were fighting
primarily for their property rights in slaves. It ignored
the supremely important fact that the war was
costing the Southern people incalculably more than
double the value of all the slaves owned in those
states. It failed to recognize the equally important
fact that, rightly or wrongly, the Southern people sincerely
believed themselves to be contending for liberty,
for the constitutional rights of the states, for the
principle of local self-government; that they were
contending against that basilar principle of imperialistic
oppression&mdash;the government of communities by
a power outside of themselves. To Mr. Lincoln's own
dictum that "no man is good enough to govern any
other man without that other man's consent" they had
added the corollary that no community and no nation
is good enough to govern any other community without
that other's consent. They were fighting, as they
confidently believed, for the fundamental principle
of self-government among men, and to that cause
they were ready to make sacrifice of slavery as cheerfully
and as heroically as they were already making
sacrifice of all else that they held dear.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln misunderstood them and misinterpreted
their attitude and their condition of mind. If
they had been offered ten thousand dollars apiece
for all their slaves&mdash;worth on the average only a few
hundreds at most&mdash;they would have rejected the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
offer angrily as a tendered bribe to induce them to
give up and betray that cause of human liberty,
states' rights, and the right of local self-government,
in behalf of which they had taken up arms.</p>

<p>To such men, inspired by such beliefs and engaged
in such a cause, no price could offer the smallest
temptation. Mr. Lincoln had misunderstood the
Southern people, as they had misunderstood him.
Their warfare had no element of commercialism or
of greed in it, precisely as his was directed not, as they
supposed, to the destruction of State autonomy, but
to the sole object of restoring and perpetuating the
American Union. As fanaticism in antagonism to
slavery could not swerve him, so considerations of
merely pecuniary advantage did not and could not
influence them. His proposal, which was in effect,
to buy all the negroes in the South, made no more impression
upon the Southern mind than would a proposal
to purchase their wives and children, or their
right to sign their own names.</p>

<p>It was under this misapprehension of Southern
sentiment that Mr. Lincoln for a space rejected every
suggestion of negro emancipation and sought to hold
his generals in the field to a policy of complete non-interference
with slavery in the Southern States.</p>

<p>We have seen in what fashion he dealt with General
Fremont's proclamation of emancipation in Missouri.
On the twelfth of April, 1862, General David Hunter,
in command of the forces on the South Carolina
coast, issued a general order to the effect that all
slaves within his immediate jurisdiction should be
confiscated as contraband of war, and instantly set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
free. On the ninth of May he issued another general
order in which he declared all negroes resident in
South Carolina, Georgia and Florida to be free men.</p>

<p>Ten days later Mr. Lincoln annulled these orders
absolutely by executive command, declaring that the
question of the emancipation of slaves was one which
he reserved to himself, and forbidding all generals in
the field to deal with it in any way, direct or indirect.</p>

<p>Congress had legislated on the subject in a very
cautious and hesitating fashion. In August, 1861, it
had passed an act authorizing military commanders
to seize and hold all negro slaves found actually employed
in the military service of the Confederacy with
the knowledge and consent of their owners. But the
act stipulated that slaves so confiscated, should not
be set free but should be held subject to the future
disposal of the Federal courts.</p>

<p>The proceedings of military officers in the field
with respect to this matter varied according to the
views and temper of each. Mr. Lincoln's revocation
of Fremont's orders led to that General's resignation.
General Hunter's act in enlisting a regiment
of fugitive slaves who had fled into his lines, gave
great alarm in Congress and in the country, lest the
war should be diverted from its Union-saving purpose
and converted into a crusade for the forcible
abolition of slavery, involving all the horrors of a
servile insurrection on the part of slaves who, in many
parts of the South, were scarcely better than half
savages.</p>

<p>General Williams, commanding the Department
of the Gulf, sought to solve the difficulty by the simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
process of turning all fugitive slaves out of his
camps, thus avoiding the necessity of deciding whether
or not he would permit masters to come within his
lines for the purpose of recapturing their slaves.
Two colonels refused to obey this order, and were
promptly removed from their commands in consequence.</p>

<p>Thus the "irrepressible conflict" of sentiment on
the subject of property in slaves divided the Federal
army and sorely vexed the country as it had done for
nearly half a century before.</p>

<p>To Mr. Lincoln it brought perplexities of the gravest
sort. It embarrassed him very greatly in his effort
to hold the war steadily to the purpose he had marked
out for it. It defeated all his hopes of persuading
the South to believe that the Government was trying
to save or restore the Union, and that the administration
was sincere in its declaration of a fixed purpose
not to interfere with the institution of slavery in
states where it constitutionally existed or to impair in
any way the autonomy of those states. Such pledges
could make no appeal to the minds of Southern men
in face of the actual interferences attempted, often
successfully, by commanders in the field.</p>

<p>Worse still, this irreconcilable division of opinion
and diversity of action, threatened to deprive the administration
of that strong support at the North
which Mr. Lincoln deemed necessary to a successful
prosecution of the war. It threatened to alienate that
great body of men at the North who were implacably
opposed to abolitionism and who held firmly to the
belief that the autonomy of the States was necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
to the maintenance of liberty, but who were ready
enough to make sacrifice of blood and treasure in aid
of a war waged solely for the preservation of the
Union.</p>

<p>In this embarrassing situation Mr. Lincoln made a
second attempt to cripple Southern resistance by securing
emancipation by purchase in the border states,
thus cutting off all hope on the part of the South that
those states would ever secede, and at the same time
in some degree satisfying the clamor of the abolitionists.
He called the border-state Congressmen about
him and earnestly, even passionately urged them to
vote in Congress for an act pledging the Government
to pay to every state that should decree emancipation
the full value of all the slaves held in such state at the
time the census of 1860 was taken. He especially besought
these representatives of border slave states to
persuade their constituents to a willing acceptance of
these terms.</p>

<p>Nothing of any practical value came of this effort.
It resulted only in stimulating on the part of the
Abolitionists that aggressive insistence upon universal
emancipation by military force which was so
sorely embarrassing to the President.</p>

<p>It was soon afterwards (August 19, 1862), that
Horace Greeley published his open letter entitled
"The Prayer of Twenty Millions" to which Mr. Lincoln
replied, setting forth his policy and purpose, in
words already quoted in this chapter: "My paramount
object is to save the Union, and not either to
save or destroy slavery. If I could save the Union
without freeing any slave, I would do it. If I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it. And if
I could do it by freeing some and leaving others
alone, I would also do that."</p>

<p>But all this while Mr. Lincoln contemplated the
emancipation of the slaves by executive proclamation
as a war measure to be resorted to whenever it should
seem to him likely to be effective. In the preceding
month of July he had drawn up a proclamation of
emancipation, and had read it to his cabinet. But he
had laid it aside, believing that the time was not yet
ripe. The Confederates seemed at that time at high
tide of military success. Their armies, victorious and
aggressive, were overthrowing one Federal force after
another, and putting Washington itself upon an
uncertain defense. It was the conviction both of Mr.
Lincoln and of Mr. Seward, that to issue an emancipation
proclamation under such circumstances would
not only seem ridiculous in the eyes of the world but
would be everywhere interpreted as a despairing
manifestation of conscious weakness, the futile outcry
of failure. He must wait for victories before
taking this step.</p>

<p>But when after Antietam, Lee withdrew from
Maryland and abandoned his campaign against the
national capital, Mr. Lincoln decided to assume the
rôle of a victor, dictating terms which he held himself
strong enough to enforce.</p>

<p>Accordingly on September 22, 1862, he issued a
proclamation declaring that on the first of January,
1863, all slaves held in those states or parts of states
which should at that time be still in rebellion should
be then and forever afterwards free.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
This was at once a threat and a promise.</p>

<p>It is a matter of curious speculation to consider
what would have been the situation if the Southern
States had submitted themselves before the beginning
of 1863. In that event the proclamation of freedom
to slaves within their borders would have been of no
effect, inasmuch as it applied only to states remaining
at war. A second executive proclamation of emancipation
would have had no war necessity to justify or
even to excuse it. For the Constitution conferred
upon the President no power to emancipate slaves.
It was only on the plea of war necessity that this
power could be remotely and speculatively inferred,
and that war necessity would have passed completely
away had the war itself come to an end before the
date set for the enforcement of the threat.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was in view of this very remote contingency
that Mr. Lincoln at that time urged upon
Congress the adoption of a constitutional amendment
forbidding slavery anywhere within the borders of the
Union.</p>

<p>Congress did not act upon the recommendation at
that time, and on the first of January, 1863, Mr. Lincoln
issued his final proclamation of emancipation,
naming the states and parts of states in which rebellion
was held then to exist, and declaring free all the
slaves within those states and parts of states. It did
not apply to those slave states which had not joined
the Confederacy, and, except that Maryland voluntarily
freed her slaves near the end of the war, the
institution remained lawful in such states as had not
seceded, and actually continued to exist there until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
December 18, 1865, when the ratification of the thirteenth
amendment to the Constitution was officially
proclaimed by Mr. Lincoln's successor.</p>

<p>So far as securing actual liberty to slaves within
the Confederate lines was concerned, the emancipation
proclamations had no effect whatever. They
were probably not expected to have any. But they
had an important bearing upon the conduct of the
war and the state of the public mind. They made an
end of all doubt about what Federal commanders in
the field should do with slaves escaping to their lines.
They satisfied the strong and growing abolitionist
sentiment at the North, and they had some effect in
alienating war Democrats and a considerable number
of Republicans from the Federal cause, thus checking
enlistments in some quarters, and impairing the administration's
support.</p>

<p>This effect was far less marked than it would have
been had Mr. Lincoln issued an emancipation proclamation
earlier in the war when he was first urged to
do so. Nevertheless the political effect was notable.</p>

<p>In the autumn elections there was a heavy falling
off in Republican majorities, while in some important
states Democrats relentlessly opposed to the administration
and all its policies were elected to replace
Republicans in office. This was notably the case in
New York, where Horatio Seymour succeeded the
Republican governor, E.&nbsp;D.  Morgan, and a sentiment
in hostility to the administration and to the war itself
grew up, which was afterwards reflected in bloody
riots when the time came for a draft of men for the
army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
In Europe and particularly in England, the emancipation
proclamation went far to change a former
friendship for the Confederacy, which had at times
threatened danger, into a strong moral support for
the Federal cause.</p>

<p>But whatever moral and political results, for or
against the Lincoln administration, this act may have
produced, it had no perceptible effect upon the actual
conduct of the war. That was still to be fought out
at the cost of millions of treasure and multitudes of
lives. Many of its greatest battles were still to come
and its most important campaigns were yet to be
fought out.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Burnside's Fredericksburg Campaign</span></span></h2>

<p>It has already been related that at the end of the
battle of Sharpsburg, or Antietam, neither army cared
to renew the contest. The two confronted each other
within deadly firing distance for the space of twenty-four
hours, doing nothing whatever. Apparently
each had so far had enough of such fighting that
neither cared to take the initiative for its renewal, yet
each was ready enough to meet the other should that
other care to assail it.</p>

<p>At the end of this waiting time Lee slowly retired
towards the Potomac, McClellan not caring to pursue,
and finally crossing the river the Confederates
went into camp near Winchester.</p>

<p>So far from planning either to press Lee or to
move by some other route upon Richmond, McClellan
seems to have thought that he had done quite all that
could be expected of him, in turning back the Confederate
invasion of the region north of the Potomac.
It appears from his dispatches to Mr. Lincoln that
he purposed with his enormously superior army to
take the defensive, post himself on the Potomac and
stand ready to meet any second attempt that Lee
might make to invade the North or to strike at Washington.
Even for such a service he did not deem his
army large enough, though it greatly outnumbered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
Lee's, or sufficiently well equipped, though its equipment
was notably superior to any that its adversary
ever had, either before or after that time.</p>

<p>Instead of planning a campaign McClellan devoted
himself to the making of multitudinous requisitions
and ceaseless complaints.</p>

<p>Precious weeks of perfect campaigning weather
were thus wasted, McClellan lying idly upon the
north bank of the Potomac while Lee rested and
reinforced his army near Winchester.</p>

<p>But if McClellan did nothing Lee was not so
supine. He did not indeed begin a new campaign or
bring on a battle, but he again awakened apprehension
of invasion at the North by sending Stuart&mdash;the same
cavalier who had ridden around McClellan's army
near Richmond&mdash;to make a raid into Maryland and
Pennsylvania which seemed for the time at least to be
the precursor of a new movement of invasion by the
Confederates.</p>

<p>On the tenth of October, with 1,800 picked cavalry
men and some light field-pieces, Stuart crossed the
river at Williamsport, above McClellan's position,
made a rapid march to Chambersburg, Pennsylvania,
and thence swept eastward and southward, riding unmolested
entirely around McClellan and returning
to Virginia on the thirteenth by passing the river
again below Harper's Ferry.</p>

<p>He brought off a rich store of ammunition, supplies
and many valuable horses, but the capture of
these was neither the primary object nor the chief
result of the daring raid. It was intended for moral
effect, and it wrought such effect in a marked degree.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
It awakened apprehension at the North, and it showed
Lee to be still capable of an aggressiveness of which
McClellan was obviously very greatly in fear. At
the North as well as at the South it gave to the situation,
after the late campaign, the appearance of one
in which the Confederates seemed in better condition
for further operations than their adversaries were.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln renewed his urgency for McClellan's
advance, and finally succeeded in inducing him to
cross the river and to seem at least to take the offensive.
But after crossing into Virginia, McClellan did
nothing effective. The history of Mr. Lincoln's effort
to set the splendid Army of the Potomac in motion
again, and the correspondence incident to that
effort, are interesting, but they do not come within
the purview of this present work.</p>

<p>Wearying at last of the inactivity Lincoln ordered
General Burnside to take command of the Army of
the Potomac, as McClellan's successor, and the new
commander decided to move down the left bank of
the Rappahannock and attempt a march upon Richmond
by a short route.</p>

<p>Establishing his base of supplies at Acquia creek
on the Potomac, only a few miles from Fredericksburg,
with a railroad connection between, Burnside
sat down on the north side of the Rappahannock, opposite
Fredericksburg, the last of his columns reaching
that point on the twentieth of November. Lee,
moving upon a parallel line, reached Fredericksburg
about the same time, and formed his lines to resist his
enemy's contemplated advance.</p>

<p>Lee's army at that time numbered about 68,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
men, but before the battle it was swelled by reinforcements
to nearly 80,000, and again reduced by detachments,
to 68,000 or less. Burnside's force numbered
about 120,000, with 147 guns, about twice Lee's
strength in artillery.</p>

<p>Fredericksburg lies upon fairly level ground, immediately
upon the southern bank of the Rappahannock,
which at that point is not fordable at any
season. In rear of the town and within cannon range,
there is a line of bold hills beginning upon the river
above the city and stretching in a curve around the
town to the eastward where they gradually diminish
in height and finally disappear.</p>

<p>Lee seized upon these hills and hurriedly fortified
them, placing his artillery in effective positions and
shielding his men with strong earthworks. Here he
concentrated the greater part of his army under
Longstreet on the left or west, and Jackson on the
right or east, while D.&nbsp;H.  Hill, with the remainder of
the Confederate army was posted at Port Royal,
twenty miles further down the river, eastward, to
meet and repel any attempt that might be made to
cross there and turn the flank of Lee's position.</p>

<p>This detachment of Hill with a strong force to a
point so far away as to forbid his direct coöperation
with the rest of the army during the battle, seriously
diminished Lee's effective strength, but the advantage
of position which he possessed and the advantage
of fighting behind breastworks which his enemy
must assail from the open, compensated him somewhat.</p>

<p>Burnside's first difficult task was to get his army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
across the river. This he could do only by the use of
frail pontoon bridges of which he purposed to lay
five&mdash;three in front of the city and two below. The
pontoon trains were slow in arriving, and when they
came it was for a time impossible to put the pontoons
into position, owing to the destructive fire of the sleepless
sharpshooters Lee had posted along the banks to
interfere with the work. In consequence of this and
other difficulties it was not until the tenth of December
that a crossing was made which Burnside had confidently
expected to make more than a fortnight
earlier.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Lee had busied himself night and
day in strengthening his position in every possible
way, and he was soon fully prepared for the contest.</p>

<p>Burnside's first assault was made about ten o'clock
on the morning of December 13. It was made in
two columns, striking simultaneously, the one against
Lee's right and the other against his left. The assault
upon his right was at first attended with a partial
success, but Jackson hurried troops to the breach and
quickly hurled the assailants back in confusion, pursuing
them nearly to the river's bank where a heavy
artillery fire checked his progress. The Federal assault
on that part of the Confederate line was not
renewed during the day.</p>

<p>From official reports and otherwise, it appears that
Burnside at first intended to direct his main attack
upon this right wing of Lee's army. The hills there
were lower and far less defensible than were those on
the Confederate left, and offered, certainly, a much
more tempting opportunity to the Federal commander.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
It was without doubt the weakest point in
Lee's line&mdash;the point which the Federals might have
assailed with greatest hope of success or at least of
inflicting the heaviest loss upon their foes. But, for
some reason which has never been clearly explained,
Burnside changed his plan of battle almost at the last
moment, and directed his heaviest columns against
Marye's Heights, the well-nigh impregnable stronghold
of Lee's left wing. Here Lee had his batteries
and a host of infantry strongly posted in formidable
earthworks on top of the hills, in a position of great
advantage.</p>

<p>For a body of troops to charge up Marye's
Heights, bristling as they did with hostile and well
served cannon, and defended by tens of thousands of
veteran riflemen, was a task that might well have appalled
even such sturdy fighters as composed the
Army of the Potomac. But the matter was made more
difficult by another peculiarity of the ground. Looked
at from below, the hill seemed to present a smooth
surface, ascending gently toward the works that defended
it. But this appearance was deceptive. On
the side of the hill well in advance of Lee's main line,
and running athwart the Federal line of advance,
there was a sunken road, faced with a stone wall,
which formed as perfect a breastwork as any that an
engineer could have constructed there. Into this
sunken road Lee threw about two thousand riflemen,
who lay there perfectly concealed from view and as
well protected against adverse fire as men using rifles
can be. Their orders were to withhold their fire until
the enemy charging up the slope under a destructive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
cannonade from above, and thinking of the works at
the top as the first obstacle to be encountered, should
reach a point a score or so of yards in front of the
sunken road, whence they could be swept away like
dust before a housemaid's broom. It was as deadly
a trap as could be imagined, and its concealment was
perfect. Yet when the Federal general decided to
make his main attack upon Lee's left, there was no
course open to him but to take this doubly defended
hill by assault or suffer fearful disaster, as he did, in
a futile attempt to do so. For the nature of the
ground on Lee's farther left rendered it impossible
to turn his flank or try conclusions with him otherwise
than by a direct charge upon Marye's Heights.</p>

<p>The first attack was made by French's division.
It was already suffering terribly under the fire from
the hilltop, when it came upon the sunken road and
was instantly swept away by a hailstorm of bullets.
Retiring, French left about one half of his men on
the field, dead or wounded.</p>

<p>Hancock charged next with five thousand men and
was driven back with a loss of two thousand or more.</p>

<p>The exact nature of the case was not even yet understood.
The position in the sunken road was still
masked to the Federal commanders. But French's
and Hancock's attempts had conclusively shown that
no courage, no determination, no heroism however
high, could enable mortal men to carry that hill by
assault. Nevertheless Burnside persisted where a
wiser leader would either have withdrawn or have
changed his plan of battle. He sent another, and another,
and still another division into that fire of hell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
only to see them instantly hurled back, shattered fragments
of most gallant commands, beaten, broken and
well-nigh destroyed by reason of a blundering obstinacy
on the part of their commanding general.</p>

<p>Finally Hooker was ordered to make another attempt&mdash;the
sixth of those futile and bloody charges.
He pointed out to Burnside the uselessness of the
effort and begged him to abandon without further
needless sacrifice of gallant men's lives, an operation
which had already been proved to be hopeless.</p>

<p>In a blind rage Burnside seemed unable to comprehend
what his subordinates saw clearly enough. He
insisted upon sending Hooker's command also into
that slaughter pen. They rushed forward,&mdash;four
thousand as brave fellows as ever fought in battle&mdash;and
a few minutes later seventeen hundred of them
lay stretched upon the field, their bodies riddled with
Confederate bullets, while their comrades, unable to
achieve the impossible, fell back as the remnants of
the other divisions had done before.</p>

<p>The Confederate war furnished two conspicuous
manifestations of supreme heroism on the part of
large bodies of men&mdash;one upon one side, the other
upon the other. Pickett's charge at Gettysburg was
one of these. This series of six charges up Marye's
Heights was the other.</p>

<p>When the sixth assault ended as its predecessors
had done, the time had manifestly come to end the
battle. A wiser commander would have ended it
much earlier, indeed. Having lost 12,353 men in an
ill-directed contest Burnside withdrew to the river bank,
baffled and beaten beyond recovery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
The Army of the Potomac had won all the glory
for itself that heroic conduct can give in the absence
of victory, but it had need now of rest, recruitment
and a new commander.</p>

<p>Burnside was clearly not equal to the task of commanding
such an army in a contest with such an adversary
as Robert E. Lee. He had himself passed
precisely that judgment upon his own capacities when
on three former occasions the command of the Army
of the Potomac was offered to him. But now that he
had accepted that command and had led to disastrous
defeat what somebody at the time characterized as
"the finest army on the planet," disappointment and
chagrin seem for the moment to have unseated his
reason. He refused to recognize the extent of the
disaster he had suffered or the conspicuousness and
completeness of his defeat. His army was torn and
broken as no other great army on either side had been
before. It was weary with futile battling, discouraged
by a failure that had involved terrible losses,
and the fact that it was not demoralized was due only
to the splendid courage and devotion of the soldiers
themselves. Worse than all it had lost confidence in
the capacity of its leader.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Burnside, reckless of any consequences
that might follow, was determined that night
to renew the battle on the following morning, himself
leading his own former corps, the Ninth, in still another
desperate attempt to carry Marye's Heights.
Earnest protests and persuasions succeeded at last in
inducing him to abandon this purpose, and after remaining
inactive for a day on the bank of the river,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
he withdrew his army, under cover of night, to the
other side of the river and the fearfully disastrous
Fredericksburg campaign was at an end.</p>

<p>Military critics have wondered much that Lee,
whose loss in the battle had been only 5,309 men, and
whose troops were almost wild with the enthusiasm of
victory, permitted his badly beaten adversary to remain
unmolested on the southern bank of the stream
for twenty-four hours and then quietly to retire.
Burnside's position and the condition of his army
strongly invited attack. He had a wide and deep
river behind him, with only a frail pontoon bridge
spanning it. Had he been defeated there by assault
on the part of the victors there would have been no
way of escape open to him. Destruction or surrender
must have followed.</p>

<p>On the other hand, his force still heavily outnumbered
Lee's and it was in no way demoralized. Defeated
and discouraged as it was its spirit was
unbroken, and had Lee left his works and assailed it
in the open, the issue of the conflict might have been
very uncertain. It is alleged that Lee's lieutenants
urged a tempestuous assault, and that Lee's chief
reason for rejecting the advice was born of his hope
that Burnside would himself on the next day renew
the attempt to dislodge the Confederates from their
well-nigh impregnable position.</p>

<p>However that may be, Lee did not in fact assume
the offensive; Burnside retired during darkness to
the farther side of the river and the two armies
settled themselves in winter quarters, Lee presently
sending large bodies of men to the southwest to reinforce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
the armies there, where active warfare was in
progress, and still more active warfare threatened.</p>

<p>The military operations of the season that thus
closed had been in every way remarkable. Four distinct
campaigns had been fought, all of them severe,
and all marked by brilliant strategy and heroic conduct
on the part of the troops on either side. McClellan's
siege of Richmond, which had filled the
South with gloomy apprehension, had been broken
in a series of bloody and impressive battles, and the
Army of the Potomac had been forced to withdraw
for the defense of Washington.</p>

<p>Pope's campaign with his Army of Virginia had
been conspicuously brought to naught by brilliant
strategy and desperate fighting.</p>

<p>Lee's invasion of Maryland had for a time reversed
the former order of things, putting the Federals on
the defensive. It had ended at last in a battle so
indecisive that both sides claimed it as a victory.
Finally Burnside's well planned but badly executed
Fredericksburg campaign had resulted in very conspicuous
defeat and failure after one of the bloodiest
battles of the war.</p>

<p>The net result of the four campaigns was one of
very great advantage to the Confederates. The
gloomy apprehension with which they had looked forward
to that summer's military operations was
changed to exultant joy and confidence as they contemplated
the situation when the work of the year
was over. They had discovered a commander for
whom their adversary had as yet found no match in
his mastery of the art of war. They were reinspirited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
by the results achieved and were full of confidence
for the future.</p>

<p>On the other side, the North rejoiced in the splendid
fighting quality of the Army of the Potomac, as
demonstrated in the Seven Days' battles, at Manassas,
at Antietam, and most of all, at Fredericksburg. The
danger which at one time seemed so imminently to
threaten their capital and the cities farther north, had
been averted, and they had confidence that the coming
spring would bring results in Virginia as pleasing to
them as those that had been achieved by Grant in the
west during the year that was coming to an end.</p>

<p>The struggle of the giants had but just begun.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Halleck's Treatment of Grant</span></span></h2>

<p>When Halleck assumed command at Pittsburg
Landing after the battle of Shiloh he seemed intent,
not only upon depriving Grant of the privilege of
vigorously following up the victory he had won but
also upon "snubbing," ignoring and humiliating that
successful general in every way possible. If Grant's
tremendous and at last successful struggle to force
Beauregard back to his defenses at Corinth had been
a crime instead of a heroic achievement, his commanding
general could scarcely have punished it in more
annoying and humiliating ways than he did.</p>

<p>It was a sore affliction to Grant to have command
taken from him at the moment when he saw before
him a perfect opportunity to pluck the ripe fruits of
his obstinate fighting by pressing forward in overwhelming
force for the completion of the conquest
for which that fighting had provided an easy and certain
way. It was still more severely painful to him
to sit still and see all the easy possibilities of the situation
he had created, deliberately thrown away by martinet
incapacity.</p>

<p>To a man like General Grant, simple minded and
sincere, a man whose sole ambition was to force the
war to a successful conclusion within the briefest possible
time, and whose vigor in action seemed to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
that result certain with the masterful means now in
hand at Pittsburg Landing, this foolish frittering
away of the opportunity he had created by his splendid
fighting, must have been the most painful of all
the punishments which Halleck at that time inflicted
upon him for his impertinence in wresting a great
victory from a calamitous defeat, before his superior
officer could reach the field and reap the credit for
himself.</p>

<p>But Halleck had other humiliations in store for
his impertinently successful lieutenant the late
Galena clerk, and the now admired and applauded
officer of volunteers. Grant even yet had no rank in
the regular army, and he had ventured to advise the
temporary dissolution of the regular army in order
that the skill and training of its officers might be
utilized&mdash;with capacity alone as the test&mdash;in making
the volunteers, who after all constituted the country's
chief reliance for its salvation, as effective in
the field as if they had been regulars.</p>

<p>We have seen how, after Grant's conquest of Forts
Henry and Donelson, and the complete rupture of
the first Confederate line of defense, Halleck forbade
him to gather the fruits of his victory, suspended
him from command and seemingly threatened
him with arrest. After Shiloh it would not have
been prudent for Halleck again to suggest the
arrest of a general whose name was on every lip as
that of the one Federal commander who was capable
of winning victories while all others were meeting
conspicuous defeats. But Halleck had other arrows
in his quiver. He left Grant as nominally his second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
in command, and, in form at least, assigned him
specifically to the command of the right wing of the
army. But he proceeded from the beginning to ignore
his second in command. He summoned him to
none of those councils and consultations to which he
invited Grant's own subordinates. Even in the matter
of orders to that wing of the army which he had
technically placed in Grant's charge, he ignored all
the courtesies and flagrantly violated all the usages
of war, by sending his commands directly to division
generals, instead of sending them through General
Grant's headquarters&mdash;thus rivaling the discourtesy
of Judah P. Benjamin in his dealings with Stonewall
Jackson. This left Grant in humiliating ignorance
even of the orders issued to divisions which were supposed
to be under his command, and for whose movements
and conduct he was held responsible. His
situation was unendurable, even to a man of his
robust habits of mind, and by way of relief he finally
asked permission to establish his headquarters as District
Commander, at Memphis, a city which had by
that time come into Federal control.</p>

<p>These details are recited here, not by way of apology
or defense of General Grant. His fame needs
no defense, and very certainly his conduct in war
needs no apology. Moreover all these circumstances,
and others that reflect still more unfavorably upon
Halleck's extraordinary treatment of the only Federal
general who at that period of the war seemed
able to achieve victories, are calmly and fully set
forth in General Grant's own memoirs. But such
details are necessary here, in explanation of that fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
and full, and impartial history of the Confederate
war, which is intended in these volumes.</p>

<p>There were repeated occasions in the course of the
struggle when vigor of generalship on the one side
or upon the other, would very certainly have brought
the war to an early conclusion, sparing both sides the
tremendous sacrifices which a lack of capable generalship
in the end entailed upon both.</p>

<p>This post-Shiloh imbecility was one of those conspicuous,
and conspicuously neglected occasions.
There is not room for doubt that if Halleck had
remained in his St. Louis headquarters, and had permitted
Grant with the now combined armies of himself,
Buell and Pope, to prosecute an instant and
vigorous campaign, the whole Mississippi Valley
would have been speedily brought under Federal
control, with all the consequences that such a conquest
must have involved.</p>

<p>After the battle of Shiloh Grant had by his own
estimate 120,000 men at and near Pittsburg Landing,
or within easy call. For in addition to Buell's
army Pope had reinforced him with 30,000 men.
Beauregard had about 30,000 effectives at Corinth&mdash;or
after Van Dorn reinforced him, perhaps 47,000.
Grant's own expert opinion expressed in print, is that
within two days he could and would&mdash;if let alone&mdash;have
captured Corinth, driving the Confederate
forces there into disorderly retreat if not compelling
their surrender, and capturing all their stores. He
would then have been in position to move in overwhelming
force upon Vicksburg and Port Hudson,
points not yet strongly fortified or heavily garrisoned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
Capturing them, as he easily could have done, he
would have made the Federals masters of the Mississippi
above Baton Rouge, while Farragut was making
himself master of all the lower reaches of the river.
In the meanwhile Grant would have prevented that
concentration and recruitment of Beauregard's army
for which Halleck gave generous leisure to his enemy
by delaying his own advance from Pittsburg Landing
for three weeks of preparation and then consuming
an entire month in pushing a force of three men
to his adversary's one over an unobstructed and undefended
space of less than twenty miles only to find
when he got to his destination that his enemy, greatly
strengthened, had in leisurely fashion retired to another
position, taking with him every pound of provisions
and every round of ammunition he possessed.</p>

<p>Here were seven of the most precious weeks of the
war lost, and the loss is very inadequately measured
by that statement. It is not too much to say that
Halleck's extraordinary deliberation and delay alone
made possible and certain all the terrible fighting and
all the losses of human life incident to the Vicksburg
campaign, just as the paralyzing incapacity of his
orders after the capture of Fort Donelson, made
needlessly possible and destructively certain the tremendous
battling of the Confederates at a later
period at Nashville, Chattanooga, Franklin, Lookout
Mountain, Chickamauga and in the Atlanta campaign.</p>

<p>If military etiquette upon either of these occasions
had permitted General Grant, with the support his
words would undoubtedly have had from Sherman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
Buell and Thomas, to set forth clearly the conditions,
needs, and opportunities in the Western Department,
the authorities at Washington would pretty
certainly have set Halleck's embarrassing authority
aside, thus giving demonstrated capacity the license
it desired to achieve results of incalculable benefit to
the National arms. But Halleck alone of all the generals
in that quarter enjoyed the privilege of direct
communication with the War Department, and Halleck
so adroitly represented&mdash;perhaps he did not consciously
or intentionally misrepresent&mdash;the facts of
the situation, that presently, on the eleventh of July,
he was appointed to succeed McClellan as Commander
in Chief of all the Union armies.</p>

<p>This was perhaps the most astonishing, not to say
the most unwise, appointment made on either side
during the entire course of the war, unless we except
Mr. Jefferson Davis's appointment of Pemberton
after he had lost Vicksburg, to the position of military
adviser of himself, with apparent authority to
control and command even Robert E. Lee.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Halleck had done all that was
possible to him to humiliate General Grant and to
deny him everything in the shape of opportunity.
General Grant, in his "Memoirs," (page 219), pathetically
says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Although next to him [Halleck] in rank, and nominally
in command of my old district and army, I was ignored as
much as if I had been at the most distant point of territory
within my jurisdiction; and although I was in command of
all the troops engaged at Shiloh, I was not permitted to see
one of the reports of General Buell or his subordinates in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
battle until they were published by the War Department long
after the event.</p></blockquote>

<p>Again on page 225, General Grant tells of an
occasion when he suggested a military movement to
General Halleck&mdash;a thing that the second in command
might very well have been expected to do.
After explaining to his readers what his suggestion
was, General Grant adds: "I was silenced so quickly
that I felt that possibly I had suggested an unmilitary
movement."</p>

<p>Yet when Halleck was ordered to Washington to
assume chief command he saw clearly that it would
not be prudent in the existing state of the public
mind to make any other than Grant the commander
at Corinth. He therefore sent word to Grant in
Memphis to report at Corinth. But he said nothing
whatever to him about his own appointment to the
command of all the armies, or about his intended departure
for Washington, or even about his intention
that Grant should assume command at Corinth. He
merely directed him to report there, leaving it entirely
to uninformed conjecture whether he was
merely to report in person for some instruction or
was to remove his headquarters from Memphis to that
point. In this uncertainty Grant telegraphed asking
whether or not he was to take his staff with him. To
this Halleck curtly and discourteously replied: "This
place will be your headquarters. You can judge for
yourself."</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Grant at Corinth</span></span></h2>

<p>When Grant took command at Corinth he found
matters in an exceedingly confused and embarrassing
condition. In the first place his authority was so ill
defined that he could do nothing of importance without
risk of subjecting himself to censure and perhaps
even to a trial by court martial for having exceeded
his authority, while if he left anything undone by
reason of his uncertainty as to the scope of his command,
he must do so at equal risk of censure or court
martial for neglect.</p>

<p>Halleck had been in command of the entire department
and of all the forces within its borders. In
leaving General Grant as his successor he did not
invest him with a similarly comprehensive authority.
Neither did he make it clear that such authority was
denied to him. So far as his orders indicated Grant
was still only a district commander, having authority
only over troops within the district of West Tennessee,
whose eastern boundary was the Cumberland
river, beyond which Halleck had sent a large part of
the forces that had been under his command at
Corinth. And yet Grant was practically a department
commander. His own exposition of the situation
is so clear, succinct and complete, that no paraphrase
can better it or equal it. On page 233 <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">et seq.</i>
of his "Memoirs," General Grant wrote:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>I left Memphis for my new field without delay and reached
Corinth on the fifteenth of the month. General Halleck
remained until the seventeenth of July; but he was very uncommunicative,
and gave me no information as to what I had
been called to Corinth for. When General Halleck left to
assume the duties of general-in-chief I remained in command
of the District of West Tennessee. Practically I became a
department commander because no one was assigned to that
position over me, and I made my reports direct to the General-in-chief;
but I was not assigned to the position of department
commander until the twenty-fifth of October. General Halleck,
while commanding the Department of the Mississippi,
had had control as far east as a line drawn from Chattanooga
north. My district only embraced West Tennessee and Kentucky
west of the Cumberland river. Buell, with the Army
of the Ohio, had as previously stated, been ordered east
towards Chattanooga, with instructions to repair the Memphis
and Charleston railroad as he advanced. Troops had been
sent North by Halleck along the line of the Mobile and Ohio
railroad to put it in repair as far as Columbus. Other troops
were stationed on the [Mississippi Central] railroad from
Jackson, Tennessee, to Grand Junction, and still others on
the road west to Memphis. The remainder of the magnificent
army of 120,000 men which entered Corinth on the thirtieth
of May, had now become so scattered that I was put entirely
on the defensive in a territory whose population was hostile
to the Union.</p>

<p>One of the first things I had to do was to construct fortifications
at Corinth better suited to the garrison that could
be spared to man them. The structures that had been built
during the months of May and June were left as monuments
to the skill of the engineer, and others were constructed in
a few days, plainer in design, but suited to the command
available to defend them.</p></blockquote>

<p>In brief Halleck had completely thrown away one
of the most brilliant opportunities of the war. He
had found an army of 120,000 men, flushed with victory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
and full of spirit, concentrated at a point in the
center of the Confederacy, from which it was not
only possible but easy to advance in overwhelming
force in any direction, while the inflow of recruits at
that time was great enough to make good and even
to double the losses that battle might involve. On
the other hand the Confederates had lost so heavily
at Shiloh that they did not venture to make a stand in
their intrenchments at Corinth, even though Halleck's
extraordinary dilatoriness gave them seven
weeks of precious time in which to recruit their army,
strengthen their defenses and receive reinforcements
of 17,000 seasoned and veteran troops that were presently
sent to them.</p>

<p>General Grant has pronounced the positive and unhesitating
opinion that an energetic advance immediately
after the Shiloh battle, with the enormously
superior forces then concentrated at that point would
have resulted beyond a peradventure in the conquest
of Corinth within two days, with the capture of all
the stores and ammunition there as a necessary incident
and the capture of Beauregard's army as at
least a promising possibility. By consuming three
weeks in preparation for an advance which ought to
have been made at once and by wasting a whole
month more in an advance by parallels, where an advance
at the quickstep with fixed bayonets, was all
that was needed, Halleck had completely thrown
away this opportunity.</p>

<p>But even then, even after wasting seven weeks in
reaching Corinth, it was not too late to achieve results
of the most momentous consequence. On page 227<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
of his "Memoirs," General Grant gives this expert
opinion of the situation and the opportunity:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Confederates were now driven out of West Tennessee,
and on the sixth of June, after a well contested naval
battle, the National forces took possession of Memphis, and
held the Mississippi river from its source to that point.
The railroad from Columbus to Corinth was at once put in
good condition and held by us. We had garrisons at Donelson,
Clarksville and Nashville on the Cumberland river, and
held the Tennessee river from its mouth to Eastport. New
Orleans and Baton Rouge had fallen into the possession of
the National forces, so that now the Confederates at the West
were narrowed down for all communication with Richmond
to the single line of road running east from Vicksburg. To
dispossess them of this, therefore, became a matter of the
first importance. The possession of the Mississippi by us,
from Memphis to Baton Rouge, was also a most important
object. It would be equal to the amputation of a limb in its
weakening effect upon the enemy. After the capture of
Corinth a movable force of 80,000 men, besides enough to
hold all the territory acquired, <i>could have been set in motion
for the accomplishment of any great campaign for the suppression
of the rebellion</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> In addition to this, fresh troops
were being raised to swell the effective force.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> The italics are not General Grant's, but are placed by the author
of the present work, upon words that seem to him to be pregnant of
criticism and explanation.
</p>

<p class="p0 sigright l2"><span class="smcap">Author</span></p>
</div>

<p>But the work of depletion commenced. Buell, with the
Army of the Ohio, was sent east, following the line of the
Memphis and Charleston railroad. This he was ordered to
repair as he advanced&mdash;only to have it destroyed by small
guerilla bands or other troops as soon as he was out of the
way. If he had been sent directly to Chattanooga, as rapidly
as he could march, sending two or three divisions along the
line of the railroad from Nashville forward, he could have
arrived with but little fighting, and would have saved much
of the loss of life which was afterwards incurred in gaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
Chattanooga. Bragg would then not have had time to raise
an army to contest the possession of Middle and East Tennessee
and Kentucky; the battles of Stone river and Chickamauga
would not necessarily have been fought; Burnside
would not have been besieged in Knoxville without the power
of helping himself or escaping; the battle of Chattanooga
would not have been fought. These are the negative advantages,
if the term negative is applicable, which would probably
have resulted from prompt movements after Corinth fell into
the possession of the National forces. The positive results
might have been, a bloodless advance to Atlanta, to Vicksburg,
or to any other desired point south of Corinth in the
interior of Mississippi.</p></blockquote>

<p>Will the reader bear in mind, that these military
criticisms are not made by the author of the
present work, although they fully commend themselves
to his judgment, but are the calm and deliberate
utterances of Ulysses S. Grant, by all consent the
ablest general that ever commanded a Federal army,
and a general minutely familiar with every detail of
the situation which presented itself after Shiloh?
They bear the authority both of intimate knowledge
and of demonstrated military skill. Reduced to their
lowest terms they amount to this: If Halleck had
been an officer fit to command an army, he would have
rushed upon Corinth with his three to one force on
the very day on which he assumed command. The
result could not have been in the least degree doubtful.
But even after he had wasted seven precious
weeks&mdash;three of them in preparation for an advance
for which he was already fully prepared, and four
more in an advance over a wholly undefended space
of nineteen miles which he ought to have covered in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
one day or a day and a half at most,&mdash;there was still
open to a capable general an opportunity which Halleck
utterly failed to see or to seize. He had under his
command 120,000 veteran troops, of the very best
fighting quality and subordinately commanded by
such masters of the military art as Grant, Sherman,
Thomas, Buell, Lew Wallace, Nelson, Prentiss and
their fit fellows. Making the most liberal allowance
for detachments to guard railroads and to hold every
acre of country conquered, General Grant says he
could have mustered an effective army of 80,000 men
or more for aggressive operations in any direction
that might have seemed best to him, against which
the Confederates could not have opposed more than
30,000 or 40,000 at the utmost. The whole central
South lay before him where to choose. His opportunity
was one the like of which came to no other
commander North or South, during the whole course
of the war. He threw it utterly away. He scattered
his superbly overwhelming army to the four winds,
under orders that rendered their courage and their
enterprise futile, and left Grant in a hopelessly defensive
position, with no army capable of any measure
of aggression, and with an authority so ill defined
that he could not order a concentration even in the
smallest way.</p>

<p>And yet, this man, Halleck, who had never fought
a battle in his life, and who had never commanded an
army except to scatter and waste it, was chosen to
command all the armies of the United States.</p>

<p>Surely the country could not have been worse
served if the administration had been intent upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
losing the war instead of carrying it to success. And
very certainly the long domination of this peculiarly
incapable man served to embarrass "enterprises of
great pith and moment," and to prolong the destructive,
fratricidal struggle for long after the time during
which, under wiser counsels, it would have endured.</p>

<p>Curiously enough no explanation of this costly
blunder has ever been suggested. We know of
course that Halleck's first appointment to command
in the West was made upon General Scott's recommendation,
at a period of the war when nobody knew
or could know what officers of the old army were
capable of achieving results and what ones were unfit
for command. General Scott's mistake in selecting
Halleck for a highly responsible command was pardonable
under the circumstances. But after his
extraordinary dealings with the victories at Fort
Henry and Fort Donelson, and still more conspicuously
after his phenomenal failure to seize upon the
opportunity that came to him ready made by the results
achieved at Shiloh, it is absolutely impossible for
the most imaginative critic to conceive of a reason
which might have justified the administration at
Washington in selecting this man with his doubly
demonstrated incapacity to direct all the armies of
the Union in their operations.</p>

<p>Not only was Grant left upon the defensive with
a force too small to permit aggression of any kind on
his part, but even this scant force was rapidly and
very dangerously depleted by orders from Halleck's
Washington headquarters. The Confederates and
guerrillas were daily threatening his communications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
and frequently attacking his defensive detachments
in force. He was confronted on the south by an
effective force of 35,000 men under Van Dorn and
Price, threatening Memphis, Corinth, Bolivar and
other points. Grant's concern for the safety of
Memphis, isolated as that post was by the Confederate
occupation of Grand Junction&mdash;between Memphis
and Corinth&mdash;was lightened only by the fact, as
he himself suggestively put the matter, that "it was
in Sherman's hands."</p>

<p>Under this stress of circumstances, and with extraordinary
disregard of what disastrous consequences
there might be involved, Halleck on the fourteenth of
August ordered Grant still further to weaken himself
by sending two more divisions to Buell on his tedious
march eastward. Again on the second of September,
Grant received orders to send still further reinforcements
to Buell, and two days later Gordon Granger's
division was detached and sent, by orders from Washington,
to Louisville. On the twenty-second Colonel
Rodney Mason, whom Grant had forgiven for arrant
cowardice at Shiloh, made a dastardly surrender of
Clarksville with half a regiment or more.</p>

<p>Thus the one commander who had thus far shown
himself capable of conceiving campaigns and conducting
them to success, was left with a totally inadequate
and constantly diminishing force, to waste his time
in guarding a vast territory while Bragg was marching
from Rome, Georgia, with a strong Confederate
army toward Chattanooga, meaning to seize that position
before Buell could get there. In his "Memoirs"
General Grant gives expression to his regret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
that he was not permitted to move, instead of sitting
still, at a time when even with the depleted force under
his command, he still felt confidant of his ability
to crush and destroy Bragg's force, thus forestalling
and rendering unnecessary the very severe and
bloody campaigns which were destined to follow for
lack of such a timely blow.</p>

<p>The Confederates, early in the spring, had enacted
and enforced a conscription law which had resulted
in putting every man in the South capable of bearing
arms, into the army. At the North&mdash;largely because
of the defeat of McClellan and Pope in Virginia, and
of Halleck's astonishing failure to follow up the
Shiloh campaign with aggressive operations&mdash;the
volunteering had so far ceased that Mr. Lincoln's
call for an additional 300,000 men met with a meager
and unsatisfactory response. In several states&mdash;New
York among them&mdash;the quotas were not furnished by
volunteering and it was necessary to order a draft to
fill up the ranks depleted by battle and disease. The
North at this time had more than twice as many men
in the field as the South could muster. But with
every southward advance of Federal armies more and
more men must be withdrawn from the active work
of aggression and set to guard places captured, to
maintain lines of communication and to hold regions
that had been overrun. Moreover the Southerners
were mainly fighting on the defensive, which in some
degree compensated for their lack of equal numbers.
Still again the enlistment of every man at the South
was to endure to the end of the war, while very large
numbers of men at the North were enlisted for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
shorter terms, some of them for only three months or
a hundred days, scarcely time enough in which to
discipline and train them into effectiveness.</p>

<p>Without offense, also,&mdash;and certainly no offense is
intended&mdash;it is fair to say that the volunteers and
conscripts who at this period of the war came into the
Confederate service, were in many cases morally superior
to the men brought by draft processes into the
armies of the Union. They were all Americans for
one thing, while great multitudes of those enlisted or
drafted into the service at the North were recent
immigrants from Europe who neither knew nor cared
for the issues involved in the contest but who entered
the service as they might have accepted any
other employment, for the sake of the money returns
promised. These money returns included, besides pay,
rations and a clothing allowance, a bounty of extraordinary
liberality, amounting in many cases to a larger
sum of money than its recipients had ever dreamed
of owning, as the price of substitution. For while
at the South every man included within the terms
of the conscription law must shoulder his musket and
go to the front, whatever his wealth or social position
might be, the case was very different at the North.
There men who had the means of buying a substitute
very often did so. Many who lacked the means or
were unwilling to pay the high price exacted by those
who stood ready to sell themselves as substitutes,
emigrated to Canada or went to Europe to escape
the military service.</p>

<p>These facts undoubtedly created a disparity between
the two contending armies, which had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
existed during the earlier part of the war. The immigrants
and the purchased substitutes who joined
the Federal armies after the campaigns of 1862 were
over, were not morally the equals of the native or long
naturalized Americans who had fought so heroically
around Richmond, at the second battle of Manassas,
at Sharpsburg, and at Shiloh. For this as well as for
the other reasons indicated, the North had need of
larger numbers than the South, in order to carry the
war to success.</p>

<p>The Confederates now held a smaller section of the
Mississippi than before, but they held that more
strongly. A general of capacity, after Shiloh, might
easily have wrested its possession from them, as General
Grant has pointed out. Under a general incapacity,
nothing was done to that end and the Confederates,
thus favored by Federal neglect, had so far
fortified their strongholds that the dislodgment which
would have been easy in the spring could now be accomplished
only by one of the severest, bloodiest and
most perilous campaigns of the war. Thus all that
had been gained above or below, towards the reconquest
of the Mississippi, had gone for next to naught.
For the possession of its mouth on the one hand, and
the control of its upper reaches on the other, meant
nothing so long as the Confederates held Vicksburg
and Port Hudson, thus obstructing a river whose sole
value was as a highway.</p>

<p>In Virginia the Southern arms had been successful
in an extraordinary degree. McClellan's splendid
army of 120,000 men had been broken and beaten
back from the very gates of Richmond, and sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
hurriedly northward to defend the National capital
itself against threatened capture. Pope, at the
head of an army quite equal to any that the Confederates
could muster, had been outmaneuvered, outfought
and overthrown at Manassas, and hurled back
upon the defenses of Washington as a needed refuge.
Lee had invaded Maryland, his cavalry amusing
themselves by unopposed marches into Pennsylvania.
Finally Burnside's attempt at Fredericksburg with
an army overwhelming in its numbers, had resulted
in fearfully bloody failure.</p>

<p>As the autumn drew on Grant was left at Corinth,
by no fault of his own but because of Halleck's orders,
with a force barely sufficient, if sufficient at all,
to hold the railroads and outlying posts which he was
set to guard. In his front there lay a threatening
army stronger than any that he could hope to bring
together at any one point. To the eastward Buell,
under paralyzing orders, was slowly marching toward
Chattanooga, while Bragg with a strong Confederate
army was hastening northward to seize that commanding
strategic position and to push thence northward
with high hopes and fair prospects of making
the Ohio river before the year was out, the dividing
line between the Northern and Southern forces, replacing
the line which by Grant's successes had been
drawn the whole width of two states further south.</p>

<p>On these points the testimony of General Grant
is too direct, too conclusive and too valuable to be
omitted here, or to be given otherwise than in his own
carefully chosen words. On page 237 <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">et seq.</i> of the
"Memoirs" he writes:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>General Buell had left Corinth about the tenth of June to
march upon Chattanooga. Bragg, who had succeeded
Beauregard in command, sent one division from Tupelo on
the twenty-seventh of June for the same place. This gave
Buell about seventeen days' start. If he had not been required
to repair the railroad as he advanced, the march
could have been made in eighteen days at the outside, and
Chattanooga must have been reached by the national forces
before the rebels could have possibly got there.</p></blockquote>

<p>On page 240 we have this careful estimate of the
situation at the beginning of September:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>On the seventh of September I learned of the advance of
Van Dorn and Price, apparently upon Corinth. One division
was brought from Memphis to Bolivar to meet any emergency
that might arise from this move of the enemy. I was much
concerned because my first duty after holding the territory
acquired within my command, was to prevent further reinforcing
of Bragg in Middle Tennessee. Already the army
of Northern Virginia had defeated the army under General
Pope, and was invading Maryland. In the center General
Buell was on his way to Louisville and Bragg marching
parallel to him with a large Confederate force for the Ohio
river. I had been constantly called upon to reinforce Buell
until at this time my entire force numbered less than 50,000
men of all arms. This included everything from Cairo south
within my jurisdiction. If I too should be driven back the
Ohio river would become the line dividing the belligerents
west of the Alleghanies while at the east the line was already
farther north than when hostilities commenced at the opening
of the war. It is true Nashville was never given up after its
first capture, but it would have been isolated and the garrison
there would have been obliged to beat a hasty retreat if the
troops in West Tennessee had been compelled to fall back.
To say, at the end of the second year of the war the line
dividing the contestants at the east was pushed north of
Maryland, a state that had not seceded, and at the west
beyond Kentucky, and this State which had been always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
loyal, would have been discouraging indeed. As it was many
loyal people despaired in the Fall of 1862 of ever saving
the Union. The Administration at Washington was much
concerned for the safety of the cause it held so dear.</p></blockquote>

<p>This was a most trying time for a man of General
Grant's overmastering instinct of activity. The task
set him of guarding a vast territory and three railroad
lines against a ceaselessly active and enterprising
enemy, gave him occupation enough it is true.
But the situation forbade him to concentrate anywhere,
or to do anything indeed except repel assaults
first upon one insignificant point and then upon another.
A mere catalogue of the actions fought at
this time in that quarter would occupy pages of print.
Only one of them had enough significance to require
mention in this history. On the thirteenth of
September the Confederate general, Sterling Price,
with a considerable force occupied Iuka, a town on
the Memphis and Charleston railroad, about twenty
miles east of Corinth. The fact was a significant
commentary upon the unwisdom of the orders which
delayed Buell's march on Chattanooga, in the end defeating
its purpose, in order to repair a railroad, any
point upon which the Confederates could seize at will
in spite of Grant's utmost diligence in an impracticable
and indeed impossible defense.</p>

<p>Grant feared that the object of Price's movement
might be something of vastly more importance than
the destruction of a railroad station, as indeed it was.
Price's purpose in seizing Iuka was to get control of
the railroad east of that point long enough to enable
him to send heavy reinforcements to Bragg, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
at that time pushing Buell back upon Louisville, with
the prospect, if reinforced in timely fashion, of capturing
that city, compelling Grant's retirement to
Cairo, and establishing the Ohio river as the northern
boundary and the military line of the Confederacy.
Accordingly Grant dangerously weakened several
exposed points in order to concentrate under Rosecrans
a sufficient force to drive Price out of Iuka before
the main body of the Confederate army south
of Corinth could join him there.</p>

<p>The operation resulted in some strenuous fighting.
Price was driven back and his scheme was defeated.
The details of the battle need not be recounted here.
They belong to the domain of minute history, covering
special campaigns. For the purposes of a general
history of the war, it is sufficient to point out the only
strategic purpose involved in the movement, and its
defeat by a timely and judicious activity.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Bragg's Campaign Against Louisville</span></span></h2>

<p>Strategically considered there was no point in the
middle South so important to either side at that time
as Chattanooga. Either side having possession of
that place could hold it against a force outnumbering
its garrison many times. More important still, its
possession by the Confederates opened to them three
or four different routes of advance into Kentucky,
which no enemy with anything like an equal force
could effectually guard or defend. To hold one of
these routes was to open another. Confederate possession
of Chattanooga at that period of the war
meant therefore the possible and even probable conquest
of all eastern Kentucky, the isolation and fall
of Nashville, the reconquest of the Tennessee and
Cumberland rivers, and the enforced retirement of
Grant's advanced army to the line of the Ohio river.</p>

<p>All these consequences, as General Grant has said,
were the probable results of a Confederate occupation
of Chattanooga in force, and had Bragg succeeded
in the campaign he directed from that point
all these consequences would have been morally certain
to befall the Union arms, as General Grant saw
at the time and afterwards set forth in his "Memoirs."</p>

<p>On the other hand the seizure of Chattanooga by a
Federal force of consequence, would have closed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
barred the gate to all further advances of the Confederates
into Tennessee and Kentucky. It would have
made the southern boundary of Tennessee permanently
the most northerly military line of division between
North and South, making of Kentucky a state
completely saved to the Union and of Tennessee a
state completely recovered to it.</p>

<p>General Halleck had sagacity enough to see, at
least in some degree, the strategic necessity of seizing
upon Chattanooga. Accordingly he ordered Buell to
march upon and occupy that place. But he seems to
have forgotten that there were energetic men in command
of Southern armies, men quite as capable as he
was of recognizing an opportunity. Instead of sending
Buell post haste to occupy the place, as General
Grant has pointed out that he should have done, leaving
the repair of the Memphis and Charleston railroad
to details of troops to be made after the main point
was gained, he threw away the advantage of a seventeen
days' start and a shorter line than that of his
enemy, and kept Buell for many weary weeks repairing
bridges and culverts while Bragg was hurrying
with all possible speed to throw a commanding force
into Chattanooga.</p>

<p>The result was that Bragg captured the commanding
strategic position and Buell was left "in the air,"
as military men say, not knowing where to concentrate
or in what direction his enemy was to be expected.
The story of his haltings, his hesitations, his
confusion of mind, his orders and counter orders, as
given in General Van Horne's "History of the Army
of the Cumberland," and in the accompanying documents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
is pitiful in its revelation of the perplexities of
an earnest, sincere and very capable officer who had
been made the victim of "orders" from an incapable
but relentlessly exacting "superior."</p>

<p>It would be an idle and wearisome waste of space
to recount here all of Buell's marchings and counter-marchings,
all the orders given and countermanded,
and given again only to be again rescinded, which
marked the progress of that campaign. For the purposes
of history it is enough to say that Bragg, with
his Confederates, in the end succeeded in maneuvering
Buell out of Tennessee and across Kentucky to the
neighborhood of Louisville, while sending a dangerously
strong detachment into eastern Kentucky to
threaten Covington and Cincinnati. The purpose of
this detachment was to compel Buell to divide his
force and send a part of it up the river to defend Cincinnati,
thus weakening the defense of Louisville,
which city Bragg intended to assail and confidently
hoped to capture.</p>

<p>That purpose failed. The moment that Cincinnati
was threatened, men in multitudes, who had not before
thought of enlisting, swarmed to the point of
danger and freely offered themselves for its defense.
It was not necessary for Buell to spare a single regiment
for Cincinnati's protection, beyond those already
holding eastern Kentucky, and even these, when
Bragg's campaign developed its purpose against
Louisville, were able to spare considerable detachments
to aid Buell in Louisville's defense. But all
this is an anticipation of events. Let us tell the story
as it occurred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
During the spring and summer of 1862, and after
Buell's main army had marched westward to reinforce
Grant at Pittsburg Landing, there had been
almost ceaseless campaigning and fighting along the
upper Tennessee river, in Alabama, and around Cumberland
Gap. Generals O.&nbsp;M.  Mitchell, G.&nbsp;W.  Morgan
and Negley were the active agents in this campaigning
on the Federal side; Kirby Smith was the
Confederate chieftain with John Morgan and N.&nbsp;B.
Forrest for his enterprising cavalry raiders. The
fighting was often severe and the maneuvers brilliant
on both sides, but in the absence of strong armies it
was after all scarcely more than skirmishing, involving
no battle of importance and no movement of
strategic consequence enough to require mention in
a general history of the war. The struggle was the
outcome of a purpose on either side to maintain the
strategic status quo, or if possible to improve it here
and there where opportunity offered. Substantially
the result was to leave matters about as they had been,
except that the continual activity and the frequent
encounters of arms served to discipline and steady the
raw recruits who were coming in on both sides. The
operations of that spring and summer served to make
soldiers of the new men North and South.</p>

<p>It was not until after Halleck sent Buell to seize
upon the strategic position at Chattanooga, and
Bragg, seventeen days later, withdrew his main body
from Grant's front and set out by the roundabout
way of Mobile to anticipate Buell, that the war in
that part of the country again assumed strategic and
historical importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
Buell's march eastward was necessarily very slow
and halting, and during its continuance he was compelled
to scatter his forces in a very dangerous
fashion. There had been two blunders made at the
outset&mdash;both of them made by General Halleck
against General Buell's protest. One of them was in
making Corinth the base of supplies for Buell's army
and depending for communication upon a long east
and west line of badly broken railroad which was exposed
at almost every point to frequent and destructive
incursions of the enemy. Buell had asked to
make Nashville his base instead. That point was
connected with Louisville by rail and still more securely
by river, and the river route was at all points
adequately guarded against interruption by an effective
gunboat fleet. From Nashville south and east
there were railroads which Buell could have guarded
effectually with one fifth the force necessary to the
very ineffectual protection of the east and west line
of the Memphis and Charleston road.</p>

<p>But Halleck was imperative in his orders and
Buell had to submit, with the ultimate result of having
to scatter his forces widely in order to guard both
lines and repair both, on pain of bringing actual
starvation upon his army.</p>

<p>The second mistake was in ordering Buell to repair
the very badly damaged Memphis and Charleston
railroad as he advanced. This, as we have already
seen, resulted in so delaying his advance that Bragg
reached Chattanooga first and was from that hour
master of the situation.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Forrest and Morgan were ceaselessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
active in Buell's rear&mdash;towards Louisville&mdash;harassing
his detachments, threatening and at times
destroying his communications, burning bridges, tearing
up railroads, gathering recruits from the youth of
Kentucky and Tennessee, throwing the people into
panic and grave uncertainty of mind, and now and
then defeating and capturing important forces.
Thus at Tompkinsville, Kentucky, Morgan routed
the Federal garrison under Major Jordan, and proceeding,
destroyed the railroad at Lebanon Junction,
and at Lebanon compelled the surrender of the force
there with a large amount of supplies which Buell
badly needed. Thence he raided all over central Kentucky,
destroying railroads of the utmost importance
to Buell and finally escaping with rich booty into the
Confederate lines again.</p>

<p>Forrest pushed out from Chattanooga and undertook
even larger operations. He assailed Murfreesborough
on the thirteenth of July, carried the place
by storm, captured the whole garrison, including its
commander, General Crittenden, and, turning about,
overcame and captured Colonel Lester on the Stone
river, with his entire force of nine full companies.</p>

<p>These actions were not battles of any special consequence,
of course. They are mentioned here
merely as illustrations of the perplexities that beset
General Buell in his march upon Chattanooga, and
ultimately made a complete failure of the attempt.
Such actions as those described were of daily occurrence,
and they compelled General Buell not only to
weaken his column by detachments sent to strengthen
exposed positions, but still further to cripple himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
by sending columns of some importance to try conclusions
with the very enterprising enemy.</p>

<p>Bragg, at the head of a strong Confederate army,
established himself in Chattanooga on the twenty-ninth
of July, some weeks before Buell could finish
the reconstruction of the Memphis and Charleston
railroad and advance to the point the occupation of
which was the sole object of his campaign.</p>

<p>Bragg at once called to his aid all the troops that
could be spared to him from points of less importance,
and very soon he was at the head of a strong force
which threatened a serious and dangerous invasion.</p>

<p>But while he was thus concentrating his forces for
a vigorous aggressive movement, Bragg adroitly concealed
his purposes. He so disposed his divisions as
to leave Buell in utter uncertainty as to his intentions.
It might be that he intended a reconquest of
Nashville. It might be that his purpose was to march
into eastern Kentucky. It might be that he intended
to move northward, take Buell in flank and rear, destroy
his communications, cut him off from assistance
or retreat, and perhaps compel his surrender. His
dispositions equally threatened each of these possible
enterprises, without in the least degree impairing his
ability instantly to concentrate his entire force for
the execution of any one of them.</p>

<p>And what his force was Buell did not know and
could not conjecture with any degree of confidence.
East Tennessee was full of Union men eager to give
helpful information to the Federal commander, but
Bragg, with an adroitness that had not before been
brought to bear upon campaigning in the west, managed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
to conceal the strength of his army even from
the citizens of Chattanooga, at the same time moving
troops about in such fashion as to suggest half a
dozen different and irreconcilable purposes. It thus
happened that the more and the more positive information
Buell received with regard to his enemy's
operations and intentions, the more hopelessly was
he bewildered. He dared not concentrate upon any
line, lest his adversary should move at once by some
other and put him in peril. No one can read General
Buell's orders and dispatches written at that time
without being strongly impressed with the hopeless
confusion and uncertainty of his mind due to a situation
that was perplexing in the extreme.</p>

<p>It was obvious that he must draw his widely scattered
forces together at some point; but where? He
could not concentrate them at any point upon the
line or in the region he was supposed to be occupying
without weakening all other points at grave risk
of having his enemy turn his position and bring him
to destruction. There was only one course that he
could pursue with even tolerable prudence. That was
to abandon his aggressive campaign, fall back, concentrate
for defense and give battle at some point of
his own selection much farther north.</p>

<p>Bragg's army consisted of five divisions of infantry
with artillery and cavalry. Buell had five divisions
in front and three others within almost instant
call, while he could depend upon being still further
reinforced from Louisville, whither a still further
part of Grant's army had been sent. But the nature
of the country in which Bragg lay, and the uncertainty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
of his intentions forbade an attack upon him
there.</p>

<p>Buell decided at last that his adversary's objective
was Nashville, and on the thirtieth of August he gave
orders for a retreat toward that place by way of
Murfreesboro. At Murfreesboro he made no pause,
as by that time Bragg's movement had developed his
purpose to go into Kentucky and make a hurried advance
upon Louisville, striking that city before Buell
could come to its defense. Buell therefore abandoned
his march towards Nashville and pushed his column
northward by hurried marches, in the hope that he
might beat Bragg in the race for the Ohio river, or
failing in that, might be in time to fall upon his adversary's
rear before he could establish himself in
Louisville's defenses. He left a small garrison to
hold Nashville but pushed forward in all haste with
his main army, in retreat upon Louisville.</p>

<p>His retreat was embarrassed at every step. Bragg
had forces ahead of him who destroyed bridges, tore
up tracks, captured important supply depots, and in
one case, at Mumfordsville, compelled the surrender&mdash;September
17&mdash;of a fortified town with its garrison,
upon which Buell had somewhat depended for a
reinforcement.</p>

<p>At first Buell had left Thomas at Nashville, to
defend that city, but his own need of strength became
so pressing that he called upon that able officer to join
him with the greater part of the troops that had been
left at Nashville.</p>

<p>What Bragg's campaign really meant, and what
he hoped to accomplish by it may best be shown by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
his own orders and dispatches. On August eleventh,
soon after he had established himself at Chattanooga,
he sent instructions to General Van Dorn who was
confronting Grant at Corinth in which he said: "It
is very desirable to press the enemy closely in West
Tennessee. We learn their forces there are being
rapidly reduced, and when our movements become
known, it is certain they must throw forces into
middle Tennessee and Kentucky, or lose those regions.
If you hold them in check, we are sure of success
here; but should they reinforce here so as to defy
us, then you may redeem west Tennessee and probably
aid us by crushing the enemy's rear."</p>

<p>On August 27, just as his army was got into vigorous
motion, General Bragg wrote to Van Dorn again
as follows: "We move from here immediately&mdash;later
by some days than expected; but in time, we hope,
for a successful campaign. Buell has certainly fallen
back from the Memphis and Charleston railroad, and
will probably not make a stand this side of Nashville,
if there. He is now fortifying that place. General
E.&nbsp;K.  Smith, reinforced by two brigades from this
army, has turned Cumberland Gap and is now marching
on Lexington, Kentucky. General Morgan
(Yankee) is thus cut off from all supplies. General
Humphrey Marshall is to enter eastern Kentucky
from western Virginia. We shall thus have Buell
pretty well disposed of. Sherman and Rosecrans,
we leave to you and Price, satisfied you can dispose
of them, and we confidently hope to meet you upon
the Ohio."</p>

<p>Two days later, on August 29, Bragg telegraphed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
Price, saying: "Buell's force is in full retreat upon
Nashville, destroying their stores. Watch Rosecrans
and prevent a junction. Or, if he escapes, you follow
him closely."</p>

<p>It will be seen from these dispatches that Bragg
had no real thought of advancing upon Nashville, as
Buell at first believed that he intended to do. His
campaign was boldly planned for a larger conquest
farther north, which, if he had been successful, would
have left Nashville an easy prey to a strong detachment,
if indeed it had failed to succumb to isolation
and fall by its own weight.</p>

<p>In these brief communications we have a complete
revelation of Bragg's plans and purposes&mdash;a complete
setting forth of his hopes. Stripped of military
technicalities his purpose was to push his army
towards Louisville in advance of Buell's retreat; to
strike and destroy the Federal general's line of railroad
communication between Nashville and Louisville,
at points north of Buell's march, thus impeding
and delaying the Federal retreat and in Forrest's
phrase "getting there first with the most men"&mdash;<i>there</i>
meaning Louisville on the Ohio river.</p>

<p>In aid of this plan he had cut off the Federal general,
Morgan, at Cumberland Gap, rendering his
force useless for any aggressive purpose and incapable
of joining Buell anywhere. He had ordered
strong forces into eastern Kentucky, to hold there all
the Federals in that quarter, to threaten Cincinnati
and perhaps to compel the detachment of a considerable
force from the garrison at Louisville for the defense
of the Ohio city. He depended upon Price and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
Van Dorn so to occupy Grant's badly depleted army
in western Tennessee and northern Mississippi as to
prevent it from moving to Buell's assistance, or
should it so move, he expected his very energetic lieutenants
to cripple it by a prompt pursuit and by vigorous
blows struck upon its rear, in the meanwhile
overrunning and reconquering the region lost in
western Tennessee and Kentucky.</p>

<p>This was without doubt one of the most brilliantly
planned operations of the entire war on either side.
It looked to no less an achievement than the undoing
of all that had been done by Grant and Buell and
Thomas, the reconquest of all the region lost and the
establishment of the Confederate lines upon the Ohio
river for both offensive and defensive operations during
the next year and the years to follow.</p>

<p>The one defect of the plan was that the Confederates
had not force enough to carry it to success, except
by some happy accident, and happy accidents were
far less likely to happen in the autumn of 1862 than
they had been a year earlier when troops were raw,
generals totally inexperienced and the problems of
war wholly unsolved even in their primary processes.</p>

<p>Bragg's force was considerably less than that
which Buell had under his immediate command. Lee
was at that time carrying on his tremendous campaigns
in Virginia and Maryland so that no troops
could be spared from that quarter to reinforce
Bragg's undertaking. Price and Van Dorn had quite
all they could do to hold their own against Grant at
Corinth and Sherman at Memphis. It is true that
Grant had been "stripped to the skin," as he expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
it, by calls upon him to reinforce Buell and to spare
division after division for the army that was contending
against Lee and doubtfully defending the
Federal capital. But on the other hand Price and
Van Dorn had been stripped equally bare to furnish
Bragg with the troops with whom he was invading
Kentucky.</p>

<p>And while Bragg was thus marching into his
enemy's country with a force only about three fifths
as numerous as that of his adversary and with no
prospect of important reinforcement from any quarter,
Buell was retreating upon a city strongly held,
whose garrison would furnish an instant and a very
strong reinforcement, while the mere threat of
Bragg's advance was inducing the hurrying of multitudes
of fresh troops from all the northwestern
states, to the menaced cities of Cincinnati and Louisville.
For it was clearly seen in Ohio, Indiana and
Illinois, and even in Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota,
that should Bragg succeed in establishing
himself on the Ohio river the states north of that
stream must become the ravaged and trampled theater
of the next year's campaign, with a Confederate
invading force swelled by enlistments from Kentucky
and Tennessee to enormous proportions and
reinforced by the fifty or sixty thousand Southern
veterans whom the conquest of the Ohio by Bragg
would instantly release from defensive work farther
south. In brief, if Bragg could have captured and
held Louisville by defeating Buell, it was morally
certain that the Confederates would have been able,
during the following spring, to invade the Northwest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
with an effective force of tremendous proportions.
For Kentucky and Tennessee would in that case
have become wholly Confederate, and the whole
South would have joined in an effort to make decisive
use of such an opportunity to end the war in
triumph. Tens of thousands of seasoned troops employed
during the summer of 1862 in garrisoning
towns and protecting railroad lines would in that case
have been set free to aid in an aggressive movement
north of the Ohio. With the Confederates established
at Louisville and holding the Ohio river as their
line, there would have been no choice but for Grant to
withdraw from Mississippi, West Tennessee and
Kentucky, thus setting free not only the 30,000 or
50,000 men confronting his present position, but also
the garrisons and armies about Vicksburg and along
the several railroads in Mississippi and in northern
Georgia and Alabama. It is certainly not an exaggeration
to estimate that had Bragg succeeded, as he
hoped, in seizing Louisville and meeting Van Dorn
and Price "on the Ohio" as he said, the Confederates
could and would have mustered at least 150,000 men
for the invasion of the Northwest at the opening of
the spring of 1863&mdash;an army greater than the South
ever put into the field at any point during the entire
continuance of the war.</p>

<p>And all this was a not impossible&mdash;indeed a not improbable&mdash;contingency.
It is true that Bragg's force
was in numbers inferior to Buell's in about the proportion
of three to five. But it was massed at the outset
and remained completely coöperating from beginning
to end of the campaign. It had besides, the advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
of knowing what it intended and whither it
was going, while Buell must vaguely guess its intentions
and hold himself ready during a retreat, to
meet his enemy wherever that enemy might see fit
to strike.</p>

<p>In war these things offset superiority of numbers
in a degree which it is difficult for the civilian reader
to understand. He who can give battle or refuse it
where he pleases, has a very great advantage over his
adversary who must accept whatever is offered or
else retreat at disadvantage.</p>

<p>Moreover Bragg had managed to get the start of
Buell in their race for Louisville, and this advantage
had been greatly increased by his success in breaking
Buell's lines of march by burning bridges, tearing up
railroads and capturing supply depots. For a time
it seemed more than probable that Bragg would reach
Louisville and occupy it before Buell could by any
possibility get there. In that event Buell would have
been cut off from all supplies, and only ordinary vigilance
on the part of the Confederates would have
been necessary to starve him into surrender&mdash;for if
thus cut off, his stores could not have supported his
army for more than three or four days at the utmost.</p>

<p>Still again, Bragg had another ground of hope. It
often happens in war, that a smaller force, skilfully
handled, masters a larger force. To go no further
back than the Seven Days' battles around Richmond,
and the campaign following, Lee had succeeded by
the skilful handling of a comparatively small force
in overcoming one army which greatly outnumbered
his own, while paralyzing the purpose of other forces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
as great as his own, that had been sent to reinforce his
enemy. With this and many other familiar illustrations
of the possibility of achieving conspicuous military
success against superior numbers present to his
mind, it was not vainglorious on the part of Bragg,
who believed in his own skill, to hope that if he could
reach Louisville in advance of Buell, his army, inspirited
by repeated successes on the march, and
holding the vantage ground of possession, might successfully
meet and defeat Buell's way-weary force,
cut off, as in that case it would have been, from its
objective, from all hope of assistance and even from
very badly needed supplies.</p>

<p>Indeed, had Bragg achieved his purpose of pushing
his columns into Louisville in advance of Buell's
coming, it would have been almost a miracle for him
to have failed in his resistance to the outmarched
Federal commander's attempts to recapture the lost
stronghold.</p>

<p>It was one of those fearful crises of the war,&mdash;like
Sharpsburg and Gettysburg&mdash;in which the whole outcome
of the struggle hung trembling in the balance,
and the future alike of the Union and of the Confederacy
was risked, as it were, upon the hazard of a
die.</p>

<p>For while Bragg was thus dragging Buell back
from northern Alabama and Georgia to the Ohio
river and more than seriously threatening to make of
that river the fortified frontier of the Confederacy,
Lee was in Maryland, after having overthrown McClellan
before Richmond and Pope at Manassas, and
the National capital itself seemed in sore danger of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
capture. The year which had opened with the Union
victories at Forts Henry and Donelson, presently followed
by Grant's success at Shiloh, while McClellan's
overwhelming divisions were near enough to Richmond
to see the spires of that city's churches, seemed
about to draw to a close so disastrous to the Federal
cause as to leave it in worse case than at the beginning
of the war or indeed at any time since the first defeat
at Bull Run.</p>

<p>The National credit was impaired as it never had
been before. The Confederates were moved to make
of the eighteenth of September a day of Thanksgiving
for a deliverance which they regarded as in effect
accomplished.</p>

<p>Enlistments at the North had so far fallen off that
drafts must be made in order to maintain that great
superiority of numbers without which the North,
fighting aggressively, could not hope to make head
against Southern defense, as all the operations of the
war up to that time had shown, and as the later course
of the contest additionally proved at every point.</p>

<p>But Bragg's effort to seize Louisville before Buell
could throw himself into that city's defenses, failed
of its purpose. By virtue of a wonderful march Buell
reached the city first, near the end of September, the
last of his forces arriving there on the twenty-ninth.
Bragg was at Bardstown, not far away and in a very
threatening position. In the meanwhile Grant held
his own at Corinth in spite of the dangerous depletion
of his forces, and the whole of West Tennessee
remained in possession of the Federals.</p>

<p>Buell found heavy reinforcements awaiting him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
at Louisville, while Bragg at Bardstown had not yet
been joined, as he had expected to be, by Kirby
Smith's force from eastern Kentucky.</p>

<p>The conditions of the campaign were thus reversed.
Buell, who had been on the defensive and in enforced
retreat, was able now to take the offensive, while
Bragg, who had been advancing with high hopes was
now in a position from which he must retreat promptly
on pain of having his army overwhelmed and
destroyed.</p>

<p>Buell quickly reorganized his army into corps,
welding the raw troops into the seasoned force, and
within a day or two he was ready to assail the enemy
who had driven him across two states.</p>

<p>Bragg retired to Perryville with a total force of
about 35,000 men, and Buell with 58,000 advanced
upon him. On the eighth of October a severe battle
occurred which lasted from noonday to night and
seemed undecided when night fell. But when morning
came Bragg had retired and was in slow and
orderly retreat southward. The Federal loss in the
battle of Perryville was reported at 4,348, including
two brigadier generals killed. The Confederate loss
is unknown, but as Bragg began the battle with only
three divisions assailing eight, and as the fighting at
times was muzzle to muzzle, the slaughter among such
troops as were actually engaged on his side, must
have been terrible.</p>

<p>Learning that Kirby Smith's command had on that
evening joined Bragg, General Buell did not press
his enemy, but disposed his forces for a defensive
battle. It was not until the thirteenth that he discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
that Bragg was indeed retreating and ordered
a pursuit. This was pressed, with some fighting
now and then, as far as Crab Orchard, where the
Federals halted, leaving Bragg free to make his
leisurely way to East Tennessee with an enormous
wagon train loaded with a rich booty of supplies
which he had gathered in Kentucky.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Fall and Winter Campaigns at the West and South</span></span></h2>

<p>The climatic conditions of the disputed country
south and west were excellent for campaigning during
the autumn, and tolerable during most of the
winter. As neither side was satisfied with the results
achieved in that quarter during the spring and summer
of 1862, both were disposed to carry on the war
with vigor during the autumn of that year and the
winter following.</p>

<p>On the third of October, while Buell and Bragg
were confronting each other near Louisville, Van
Dorn, who had been heavily reinforced from Missouri,
undertook to carry out Bragg's orders, for the
capture of Corinth and the reconquest of western
Tennessee and Kentucky. He advanced upon Corinth
in force and assailed Rosecrans, who held the
immediate command of that place, upon lines chosen
by the Federal commander, three miles in front of
the main defenses.</p>

<p>It was a rich prize that the Confederate commander
battled for, and right manfully did he strive to gain
it. Corinth at that time was a depot of supplies of
unusual consequence, and besides that, its conquest
would mean the complete breaking of Grant's long
and difficult line of defense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
During the first day of terrific fighting, Van Dorn
succeeded in driving Rosecrans back to the refuge of
the town's fortifications. On the next morning he
assailed the works with extraordinary vigor and determination.
His men suffered terribly from the
cannon and musketry fire of a protected enemy at
short range, but they succeeded at last in breaking
the defenses and forcing their way into the town
where they fought inch by inch through the streets.
For a time it seemed certain that they must succeed
not only in carrying the town and capturing the stores
that had been collected there, but also in compelling
the surrender of the defending force, twenty thousand
strong, with the multitude of large guns
mounted upon the works. But reinforcements came
to Rosecrans's aid at the critical moment and turned
the tide of battle just in time to prevent a great disaster
to the Federals. The Confederates were driven
back and after a heavy loss, never accurately reported,
they retreated from the place.</p>

<p>Grant had ordered Rosecrans, should this occur, to
pursue with all his force and crush the Confederate
column completely. Rosecrans delayed even the beginning
of pursuit from noon, when the retreat began,
until the morning of the next day and then, by
a mistake in the road taken, lost even the little chance
left to him of effective pursuit.</p>

<p>Grant was sorely displeased with this loss of an
opportunity which had been purchased at cost of so
severe a battle, and at his request Rosecrans was removed
to another field. He was sent in fact, after a
brief time, to succeed Buell, whose failure to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
greater damage to Bragg met with condemnation at
Washington.</p>

<p>The Confederate authorities were equally displeased
with their general, Van Dorn, and soon afterwards
he was superseded in command by General
John C. Pemberton.</p>

<p>Pemberton was a Pennsylvanian by birth, who had
married at the South. He was a special, personal
favorite of President Davis. He had never commanded
an army or conducted a battle in his life, yet
Mr. Davis had rapidly promoted him all the way from
colonel to lieutenant general, over the heads and to
the great discouragement of colonels, brigadiers and
major generals who had won high distinction upon
hotly contested Confederate battlefields. And now,
when the Federal forces were firmly established on
the far Southern line of the Memphis and Charleston
railroad, and when the very greatest generalship was
obviously and peremptorily needed to save the Confederate
cause in the South and West, the Richmond
authorities selected this favorite, who had done no
fighting, commanded no armies and manifested no
military ability, to take control of Confederate defense
at the most critical point of all.</p>

<p>The result was quite what might have been expected.
Pemberton was badly defeated every time he
gave battle and it was he who surrendered Vicksburg
and the Mississippi river on the fourth of July after
a brave but incapable defense. The history of that
belongs to a later chapter. And even after this extraordinary
demonstration of his unfitness and incapacity,
and at a time when very many at the South seriously&mdash;though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
unjustly&mdash;suspected him of having
deliberately betrayed their cause, Mr. Davis appointed
this man to a post which seemed at least to give him
authority to control General Lee himself. This latter
appointment was so quickly and so hotly resented by
an army that well nigh worshiped Lee, that Mr.
Davis wisely modified it before it had time to provoke
a protest that might have savored of mutiny.</p>

<p>When Rosecrans superseded Buell, on October 30,
1862, the Federal army was in process of concentration
at and near Bowling Green. Within a few days
the concentration was complete, and Rosecrans was
ready for active campaigning with a great army, inspirited
by recent successes, strongly reinforced, effectively
reorganized and full of hopeful determination.</p>

<p>But in what direction to advance was an unsettled
problem. Rosecrans was strongly urged from Washington
to move at once into East Tennessee, threatening
Chattanooga and giving encouragement to the
Unionists in that quarter. But Nashville was in serious
danger. It had been held by a comparatively
meager garrison during the Perryville campaign,
against a strong Confederate force under Breckinridge,
and there was more than a chance that Breckinridge
might now capture the position unless Negley,
with the two divisions under his command there, could
be promptly supported. The importance of Nashville
to the Federal armies as a secondary base of
supplies was very great. Whether Rosecrans should
campaign to the east, west or south, his need of depots
at Nashville must be imperative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
While he was pondering the question of an objective,
Bragg settled it for him. The Confederate general
had retired from Kentucky rather of his own
choice than under compulsion. He had suffered no
disaster. At Perryville indeed he had had the best
of the fighting for a large part of the day, and he
had retired in the night rather with the purpose of
giving battle again at some more favorable point than
with intent to avoid battle with an enemy in strongly
superior force. That enemy had not seen fit to follow
and press him, and so there had been no further trial
of conclusions. The Confederates had indeed failed
to capture Louisville and establish themselves on the
Ohio, but they had met with so much success not
only in the various actions fought but also in demonstrating
their ability to advance or retreat at will, that
they came out of the campaign feeling themselves, in
effect, victors. They were full of spirit and eagerly
ready for further campaigning.</p>

<p>With his army in this mood and with a secure base
behind him at Chattanooga, Bragg promptly moved
upon Murfreesboro, with manifest intent to join
Breckinridge and carry Nashville with a rush, if
Rosecrans should fail to succor that strategic key to
the situation.</p>

<p>Murfreesboro lies on the Nashville and Chattanooga
railroad, a scant forty miles southeast of Nashville.
The country between is open and so completely
unobstructed by physical features of difficulty, that
the railroad shows scarcely a curve in its course between
the two points.</p>

<p>In view of Bragg's advance there was but one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
course open to Rosecrans. He must strengthen the
defenses of Nashville and concentrate there for defensive
and offensive operations.</p>

<p>He promptly threw a strong force into Nashville
and soon his entire army was concentrated there, except
such detachments&mdash;and these were large&mdash;as
were employed in rebuilding the railroad between
Louisville and Nashville, which the Confederates had
destroyed, and those other and still larger detachments
which were necessary to defend that vitally
important line of communication against the ceaseless
activity of Forrest and Morgan, who were
making themselves destructively ubiquitous.</p>

<p>Rosecrans's activity was such that he succeeded in
rendering Nashville secure before Bragg could carry
out his purpose of assailing that stronghold. Still
Bragg did not despair of his purpose. He sent peremptory
orders to the forces around Corinth, either
to send him strong reinforcements or to carry on such
a campaign in their own districts as should compel
Rosecrans to weaken himself at Nashville by sending
heavy reinforcements to the west.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bragg fortified himself at Murfreesboro,
establishing his lines along and across Stone
river&mdash;a little, easily fordable stream&mdash;about two
miles in front of the town.</p>

<p>Rosecrans decided to assail him there, and to that
end advanced with 47,000 men. His march began on
the twenty-sixth of December, and by the thirtieth he
was in position to assail his enemy with an effective
force of 43,700 men. His plan of battle was to throw
forward his left wing in force, envelope his enemy's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
right and crumple up his lines by pushing into action
a ceaseless stream of fresh troops, wheeling his divisions
to the right as they should be successively
brought into action.</p>

<p>But Bragg was also an officer of great energy and
activity, and he had under his command a force nearly
if not quite equal to that of his foe. He was at disadvantage
during Rosecrans's sudden and unexpected
advance from Nashville, from the fact that he had
sent away his cavalry under Wheeler, Forrest, and
Morgan to assail Rosecrans's communications at a
time when that general was not expected to take the
initiative in a winter campaign in the field. But now
that Rosecrans was in his front, and obviously intending
immediate battle, Bragg in his turn determined
to assume the aggressive and himself bring on the
action. His plan was absolutely identical with that
of Rosecrans, namely to push forward his left wing,
envelope and crush his enemy's right and by successive
right wheels to destroy his foe or drive him into
retreat. Thus Rosecrans intended to begin the battle
at one end of the line while Bragg meant to begin it
at the other.</p>

<p>Each of course massed his forces at the point where
he purposed to make his first assault, and each thus
weakened his line at the point which his enemy was
planning to assail.</p>

<p>As a consequence the initiatory advantage must of
necessity lie with the force that should succeed in making
itself the first aggressor, bringing on the battle
before the other was ready and striking the other's
weakest wing with his own strongest divisions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
That advantage fell to Bragg as a reward for his
alertness in striking as soon as possible after dawn
on the last day of the year. He had so extended his
left as completely to overlap Rosecrans's right and he
fell upon it in flank with resistless impetuosity. The
force defending it was quickly crushed and the
Confederates, advancing with enthusiasm, bent back
the next division encountered, and after some strenuous
fighting, forced it to retire upon a new line which
Rosecrans had hastily established at right angles to
that of the morning.</p>

<p>The fighting continued with desperate determination
and great slaughter on both sides until nightfall.
The advantage was conspicuously with the Confederates,
though there was no decisive victory won. Rosecrans
had held his position indeed, upon a part of his
line, and had not been either destroyed or forced into
retreat. But the Confederates had driven him from
one half or more of the ground that he had held at the
beginning of the battle, had captured twenty-eight
of his guns and large numbers of prisoners, while
their cavalry had marched entirely around him and
fallen upon his communications in a way that very
seriously threatened him with an isolation that must
have involved his destruction.</p>

<p>Rosecrans had been badly worsted in battle, but he
was not yet beaten. His army was not demoralized,
and his own determination was not impaired. He
took account of his ammunition, sent detachments to
protect his communications, and resolved to hold his
position and renew the battle on the following day,
either as the assailant of his enemy or as the assaulted,
as circumstances might determine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
But the next day was passed in inaction on both
sides, and it was not until the second of January,
1863, that the battle was renewed. Even then it was
renewed only in part and obviously with no disposition
on either side to bring on a general engagement.
Nevertheless there was very bloody fighting on the
part of the detachments engaged, in which the Confederate
general, Breckinridge, becoming involved
and being subjected to a concentrated artillery fire at
short range, lost nearly two thousand men.</p>

<p>Two days later and after desultory fighting, General
Bragg abandoned his position at Murfreesboro
and retired to Duck river, where he fortified. He reported
his losses in this battle&mdash;which is variously
known as Murfreesboro, and Stone river&mdash;at 10,000
men, and declared that he had taken 6,000 prisoners.
He had also captured thirty guns and lost three. On
the other hand, General Rosecrans reported a loss of
8,778 in killed and wounded, and about 2,800 in prisoners
lost to the enemy&mdash;a total of somewhat less
than 11,000. The two reports are hopelessly at variance
and irreconcilable, as to the number of prisoners
taken, as was usually the case with the reports of
battle losses at that period of the war. They were
usually inaccurate and never trustworthy, as every
historian who has honestly tried to find out the truth
has learned to his annoyance.</p>

<p>But whatever the exact losses were on either side,
they were far greater than were those of many more
famous battles, and about as great as those of the
battles commonly accounted as of superior proportions.
Thus the loss admitted by the Confederates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
at Murfreesboro out of a force of about 35,000 or
40,000 men, was nearly twice that which Lee, with
a force of 68,000, suffered at Fredericksburg; while
the admitted Federal loss at Murfreesboro, where the
army numbered 43,700 men, was very nearly as great
as that sustained by Burnside's army of 120,000 at
Fredericksburg, including the fearful slaughter in
the six terrible assaults upon Marye's Heights.</p>

<p>Obviously the battle of Murfreesboro must be accounted
one of the bloodiest struggles of the war, as
well as one of the most heroically contested on both
sides. Its indecisiveness has been very interestingly
summed up by General Van Horne in his "History
of the Army of the Cumberland" as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Neither army commander had fully executed his plan of
battle, although General Bragg had approached very nearly
the completion of his. He had turned a flank of the National
army, bent back the right to the rear of the center, but had
failed to turn its left or reach its rear, and hence had not
gained the extreme advantages which he had anticipated in
assuming the offensive and [which he] had seemingly attained
at the grand crisis of the battle. He had assaulted
boldly and persistently from first to last, but had completely
exhausted his army without gaining a decisive victory. General
Rosecrans had fought a battle radically different from
the one he had proposed for himself. Instead of turning
the right of the Confederate army and taking its center in
reverse, according to his plan, he had been forced into the
most emphatic straits in maintaining the defensive from
flank to flank. Both commanders had lost heavily; General
Bragg by continuous assaults with massed forces, and General
Rosecrans by resistance at each point to superior numbers,
and by frequent recessions under the guns of the enemy....
A battle whose emergencies of offense and defense involves
the use of all reserves, must necessarily be a bloody one.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>
<p>It is seldom that an engagement of such dimensions has
left two commanding generals so much in doubt as to the
course that either would adopt, and hence each determined to
await developments, and each was ignorant of the purpose of
the other. Of the two General Bragg was the more hopeful.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the end, as we have seen, both armies fell back
and fortified, and campaigning ended in the southwest
for that season.</p>

<p>Other events of that winter may be briefly summarized.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln's emancipation proclamation became
effective on the first of January.</p>

<p>The Confederate Congress passed a second conscription
bill in February extending age limits both
ways and putting practically every able-bodied white
man in the South into the army.</p>

<p>The Federal Congress, on the third of March,
authorized the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus,
thus virtually establishing martial law throughout the
North.</p>

<p>A Confederate loan of $3,000,000 was promptly
subscribed for in Europe.</p>

<p>On the seventh of April the fleet off Charleston
assailed the defenses of that city, but was beaten off
with the loss of one ironclad, the monitor, Keokuk,
sunk.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Chancellorsville Campaign</span></span></h2>

<p>However important the operations at the West and
South might be, the vital seat of the war was always
in Virginia.</p>

<p>There the contending armies ceaselessly threatened
the two capitals, the conquest of either of which would
have been decisive. There both sides concentrated
their best armies. There was present the Confederate
Army of Northern Virginia under Lee, of which
General Hooker, after being overthrown and beaten
by it, testified: "That army has, by discipline alone,
acquired a character for steadiness and efficiency, unsurpassed,
in my judgment, in ancient or modern
times. We have not been able to rival it nor has there
been any near approximation to it in the other rebel
armies."</p>

<p>And there on the other side was present for duty
that Army of the Potomac which had so distinguished
itself for heroic devotion and unfaltering courage
upon a score of desperately contested battlefields.</p>

<p>After Burnside's bloody defeat at Fredericksburg
the authorities at Washington proceeded to swell the
Army of the Potomac to vast proportions until as the
spring of 1863 approached, its total was no less than
180,000 men and 400 <span class="locked">guns.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> These are the figures given by Col. Theodore A. Dodge, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;A. ,
in his singularly able monograph on "The Campaign of Chancellorsville,"
pages 2 and 19.</p></div>

<p>Meanwhile operations below Richmond had compelled
Lee to detach about one fourth of his force,
thus reducing his strength to a total of 58,100 men
and 170 pieces of artillery.</p>

<p>There was one important difference, however. In
Lee the Southerners had found their very ablest commander,
a master of all the arts of war, and an absolute
master of the hearts of all the men who served
under his command.</p>

<p>The Army of the Potomac had been commanded
in succession by McDowell, McClellan, Pope, McClellan
again, and Burnside, no one of whom had
manifested an ability to contend successfully with
Lee, even with the unstinted resources given into the
hands of each. The Army of the Potomac still lacked
a capable commander and the lack was for long a determining
factor of the problem.</p>

<p>Colonel Dodge, an officer of the United States
army, and a historian of exquisite conscientiousness
and high repute, puts the matter in these words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Great as was the importance of success in Virginia, the
Confederates had appreciated the fact as had not the political
soldiers at the head of the Federal Department of War. <i>Our
resources always enabled us to keep more men, and more and
better material, on this battle ground</i> than the Confederates
could do; but this strength <i>was constantly offset by the ability
of the Southern generals</i><a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> and their independence of action
as opposed to the frequent unskilfulness of ours, who were
not only never long in command, but were then tied hand
and foot to some ideal plan for insuring the safety of
Washington.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> Italics ours. <span class="smcap">Author.</span></p></div>

<p>No impartial student of the history of the war can
doubt that Colonel Dodge here touches the very marrow
of the matter. In the operations in Virginia the
North had more men, often by two or three to one,
more guns and incalculably better supply departments.
Their men were as good as the Southerners.
Their guns were better, and their materials immeasurably
superior both in quantity and quality. But
until Grant was summoned from the West in 1864 to
take command, the Army of the Potomac was commanded
by no general who had capacity enough to
make effective use of these superior advantages in a
contest of strategic wits with Lee.</p>

<p>The real problem which the Washington authorities
were set to solve was to find a general equal to this
task, and so long as Halleck remained commander in
chief of the Federal forces, there was no hope of success
in that search. Commander after commander
had been set up only to be promptly and disastrously
bowled down again by Lee, in spite of the enormous
disparity of numbers, guns and equipment.</p>

<p>But neither Grant nor Sherman was among those
who had been appointed to try conclusions with Lee.</p>

<p>Halleck was still supreme as the military counselor
of Mr. Lincoln. Grant, in spite of his victories, was
a peculiarly objectionable person to him, and Sherman
labored under the serious disability of enjoying
Grant's favor and esteem in a very high degree.</p>

<p>But after Burnside's failure it was necessary to find
a new commander for the Army of the Potomac, and
Mr. Lincoln selected General Joseph Hooker to
make the next attempt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
General Hooker was an old army officer. He was
thoroughly equipped so far as military education was
concerned, and he was so ardent in the work of the
soldier that his men had lovingly nicknamed him
"Fighting Joe Hooker." But he had never commanded
an army or planned a campaign. He had
made the last and most brilliant of that series of
heroic charges up Marye's Heights which Burnside
had so foolishly ordered at Fredericksburg. He had
made the charge under protest, correctly deeming it
a needless sacrifice of men's lives in a hopeless undertaking.
But he had made it with extraordinary gallantry
and had persisted in it until, as he sarcastically
said, "he thought he had lost as many men as he was
ordered to lose."</p>

<p>Of his devotion as a soldier, and of his unusual
capacity in subordinate command, he had given adequate
proof in every battle in which the Army of the
Potomac had been engaged, from Manassas to Fredericksburg.
But his capacity to lead a great army
against a great enemy was wholly conjectural. Mr.
Lincoln suggested this in the extraordinary letter in
which he announced to Hooker his selection for this
supreme trust. That letter was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sigright">
Executive Mansion, Washington,<br />
<span class="l2">D.&nbsp;C. , January 26, 1863</span>
</p>

<p class="p0 in0">Major-General Hooker:</p>

<p>General:&mdash;I have placed you at the head of the Army
of the Potomac. Of course I have done this upon what
appears to me to be sufficient reasons, and yet I think it best
for you to know that there are some things in regard to
which I am not quite satisfied with you. I believe you to be
a brave and skilful soldier, which of course I like. I also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
believe you do not mix politics with your profession, in which
you are right. You have confidence in yourself; which is
a valuable if not an indispensable quality. You are ambitious,
which, within reasonable bounds, does good rather than harm;
but I think that during General Burnside's command of the
army, you have taken counsel of your ambition, and thwarted
him as much as you could, in which you did a great wrong
to the country and to a most meritorious and honorable
brother officer. I have heard, in such a way as to believe it,
of your recently saying that both the army and the government
needed a dictator. Of course it was not for this but
in spite of it, that I have given you the command. Only
those Generals who gain success can set up dictators. What
I now ask of you is military success, and I will risk the
dictatorship. The government will support you to the utmost
of its ability, which is neither more nor less than it has done
or will do for all commanders. I much fear that the spirit
you have aided to infuse into the army, of criticizing their
commander and withholding confidence from him, will now
turn upon you. I shall assist you as far as I can to put it
down. Neither you nor Napoleon, if he were alive again,
could get any good out of an army while such a spirit
prevails in it. And now, beware of rashness. Beware of
rashness, but with energy and sleepless vigilance go forward
and give us victories.</p>

<p>Thus commissioned, Hooker undertook the task in
which so many predecessors had failed&mdash;the task of
overcoming Lee, breaking the resisting power of his
really wonderful Army of Northern Virginia, conquering
the Confederate capital and adding Virginia,
with her pith and substance, to the list of states reconquered
to the Union.</p>

<p>For this task he had more adequate means than any
of his predecessors or even any of his successors enjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
until Grant, in 1864, concentrated the whole
military force of the nation and coördinated all its
operations with this one object in view.</p>

<p>Hooker had an army of 180,000 men, to Lee's less
than 60,000&mdash;about three men to one. He had 400
pieces of artillery to Lee's 170, and both his guns and
his ammunition were superior to Lee's. He had unsurpassed
quartermaster and commissary departments,
a matter in which Lee was wofully deficient.
The railroads in Hooker's rear were in excellent condition,
while those upon which his adversary must
depend were well-nigh hopeless wrecks, with nearly
helpless engines and a lamentable insufficiency of
cars. Still further, the Northern army was filled with
skilled mechanicians and practical engineers capable
of quickly meeting and overcoming any mechanical
difficulty that might arise. In one case early in the
war it is related that an engine in Federal service ran
off the track and was badly damaged, thus threatening
serious embarrassment to a military movement.
When the question arose as to what could be done
with the crippled engine, a private stepped from the
ranks, saluted respectfully, and said: "I built that
engine. I guess I can repair her."</p>

<p>The South had next to none of this sort of resource.
Nor had it anywhere great shops capable of producing
machinery. The South had been an almost exclusively
agricultural country, in which the mechanic
arts were scarcely at all developed.</p>

<p>With such advantages and others of scarcely less
importance, it seemed a not very difficult task for
Hooker so to employ the 180,000 hardened veterans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
of the Army of the Potomac as to overcome the resistance
of the 58,100 composing the Army of Northern
Virginia. The Government at Washington expected
nothing less than this. The people of the
North demanded such results as their right. The
army itself stood eagerly ready to do the work required,
for the Army of the Potomac believed in
Hooker as it had not previously believed in any of its
commanders except McClellan before that general's
career was clouded by defeat. The men had seen
Hooker fight. They were in love with his rough and
ready ways. They repeated around their camp fires
his witty sayings, and mightily rejoiced in them.
They had indeed none of that filial reverence for him
which the men of the Army of Northern Virginia
felt for Lee&mdash;whom they affectionately called "Mas'
Bob." But they had for Hooker an almost boyish
enthusiasm which was without doubt an important
element of strength.</p>

<p>Hooker began right. He was a master of the art
of military organization, and he quickly brought the
army under his command into a state of positively
wonderful efficiency. Then he planned a brilliant
campaign&mdash;a campaign far better conceived than any
that Lee had yet been called upon to meet.</p>

<p>Fully recognizing his own superiority in numbers,
in guns, in equipment, in supplies, in the materials of
war and in that mobility which such superiority necessarily
gives, he planned to utilize all these advantages
for the certain and quick destruction of his
adversary.</p>

<p>He could force the fighting when and where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
pleased. He could choose his own battlefields and
his own time for action.</p>

<p>He had no thought of repeating Burnside's blunder
and assailing Lee in his own chosen and strongly
fortified position, at Fredericksburg. It was his intention
instead to force Lee out of his fortifications
and compel him to fight against tremendous odds in
the open field.</p>

<p>His plan was, with enormously superior numbers
to turn both of Lee's flanks at once, compel the division
of his already inferior army, overcome both
wings of it in detail, and crush it completely. That
done, Confederate resistance in Virginia would be at
an end. Richmond would lie before him a helpless
prey. Virginia would be a conquered state, and the
completion of the war a mere matter of detail.</p>

<p>All military critics who have considered the subject,
agree that this was the best planned campaign that
any Northern general had as yet originated and that
its promise of success, with the great superiority of
means behind it, amounted almost to a certainty. Its
failure in the end was disastrous in the extreme and
discouraging beyond anything that had occurred since
the first battle of Manassas.</p>

<p>These facts taken together&mdash;the brilliancy and the
entire soundness of the plan of campaign, the stupendous
superadequacy of the means at command
for carrying it to success, and its conspicuous failure
in the end&mdash;render the history of the campaign of
Chancellorsville one of the most dramatic of the wonder
stories of the Confederate war.</p>

<p>After three months of most intelligent and energetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
work in perfecting organization and bringing
all parts of the service into the highest condition of
efficiency, Hooker was ready at last to begin his campaign.
Omitting all the sick, all detachments, all
forces sent to guard communications, all furloughed
officers and men, he had "for duty equipped," according
to his morning reports, no less than 131,491 men,
with 400 pieces of highly effective artillery. Opposed
to him was Lee with a total force, of all arms, of
58,100 men, of whom less than 50,000 were ready for
duty, and about 170 pieces of artillery, mostly of an
inferior sort. Some small reinforcements are believed
to have come to Lee, swelling his force to about
60,000 men all told, or perhaps 55,000 effectives.</p>

<p>With numbers so overwhelming, Hooker was free
to do pretty nearly whatever he might choose to do
without risk of weakening himself at any point below
the strength of his enemy.</p>

<p>His plan of campaign was simple and strategically
admirable. Broadly stated it was this:</p>

<p>1. To push a strong force of cavalry, under Stoneman,
around Lee's left and into his rear, to destroy
his communications, and to harass and prevent his
retreat towards Richmond&mdash;for Hooker's plans
looked to nothing less than the capture of the whole
Army of Northern Virginia.</p>

<p>2. To send a strong force of artillery and infantry
under Sedgwick down the river to cross there, turn
Lee's right, force whatever might be left of his army,
by that time, out of their entrenchments, and mercilessly
assail him in flank on his expected retreat
toward Richmond, thus additionally making his surrender
inevitable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
3. At the same time to march up the river with the
main body of the Federal army, estimated by Lieutenant
Colonel Theodore A. Dodge, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;A. , at
120,000 men, push the head of his column across the
stream far up it, sweep down the southern bank, clear
the several fords in succession and at each to send
fresh columns across; then, in irresistible force to
march through the Wilderness, as that tangled country
is called, and emerge from it in appallingly
overwhelming numbers at Chancellorsville.</p>

<p>This would completely turn Lee's left with the
main army and force him either to retreat hurriedly
toward Richmond with Sedgwick on his flank, or to
give battle in the open, with utterly inadequate forces.</p>

<p>Never during the whole course of the war was there
a campaign more brilliantly planned than this one
was to compel victory; never did one fail more conspicuously.
Never were the advantages of the assailant
so great; never were they so completely offset by
the genius of the defending commander and the resolution
of an army vastly inferior in numbers and in
the appliances of war,&mdash;in every element of strength
indeed except high soldierliness.</p>

<p>Stoneman moved on the thirteenth of April. His
orders were to pass up the river, keeping well out of
sight and masking his movement, to wheel suddenly
and cross the stream at a point west of the Orange
and Alexandria railroad, destroy Fitzhugh Lee's
cavalry at Culpeper, seize upon Gordonsville, where
the Orange and Alexandria and the Virginia Central
railroads form a junction; push on toward Richmond;
cut the Richmond and Fredericksburg railroad at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
Hanover Junction, thus cutting off Lee's retreat;
fortify himself there in strong positions and obstinately
oppose any effort of Lee to retreat, until
Hooker, moving from Lee's left and Sedgwick, moving
from his right, should join forces with Stoneman
and complete the work of destroying the Army of
Northern Virginia. This culmination of the campaign
was planned to occur six days after Stoneman's
start.</p>

<p>Stoneman made the first failure. He moved up the
river and crossed a part of his force. But high water
soon afterwards rendered the stream unfordable,
while Lee's alert cavalry lieutenant J.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B.  Stuart,
confronted the force already crossed, and compelled
it to retreat by swimming to escape certain destruction.</p>

<p>This ended the cavalry part of Hooker's program.
For the ford did not become passable again until the
twenty-seventh and by that time the main movement
had been begun. It was too late for Stoneman to do
his part of the work.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the crossings at and near Port
Royal, about twenty miles below Fredericksburg, had
been secured, and bridges had been laid. On the
twenty-ninth of April, early in the morning&mdash;before
daylight in fact,&mdash;General Sedgwick forced a crossing
with three corps. In preparation for this, ninety-eight
guns had been previously placed in position
under Hooker's direction and a number more held in
reserve.</p>

<p>Sedgwick's orders were to seize a principal road,
turn Lee's right flank, and in case of serious opposition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
to carry Lee's works at all costs; then to push
forward on Lee's flank and harass his retreat. It
was expected that Stoneman would by this time be
fortified in the way of Lee's retreat, and that the
main body of the Federal army under Hooker, moving
from Chancellorsville, would fall upon the Confederates
and crush them.</p>

<p>With these dispositions made, Hooker moved up
the Rappahannock and the Rapidan, crossed forces
at the upper fords, moved thence down the right or
Confederate bank of the stream, uncovering the several
fords in succession, and crossing heavy forces at
each.</p>

<p>Once across the Rapidan he moved his army rapidly
through the Wilderness, to Chancellorsville, a solitary
plantation house near the Southern edge of that vast
thicket.</p>

<p>In posting himself at Chancellorsville Hooker had
placed his army far to the rear of Lee's left at Fredericksburg.
It was obvious that Lee must quit his
entrenchments and move southwest to meet his adversary
at Chancellorsville, otherwise his army would be
completely cut off, overwhelmed and conquered, and
the road to Richmond would be opened to his adversary
with no possibility of effective resistance anywhere.</p>

<p>But Lee had not been asleep. Neither was he appalled
by the enormous advantages of numbers, guns
and position enjoyed by his adversary.</p>

<p>With that calm self-possession which was the keynote
of his character; with that masterful skill in the
art of war which had so often served him in lieu of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
heavy battalions, and which then and since has commanded
the admiration of military men both north
and south; and, above all, with that confidence in the
superb endurance of his veterans which their conduct
on many fields had taught him to feel, he set to work
to meet and defeat Hooker's admirably planned campaign.</p>

<p>He left 8,500 men and thirty guns to hold the
works at Fredericksburg, so long as they could be
held against Sedgwick's 30,000 men and more than
100 guns. With the remainder of his army,&mdash;in
round numbers about 45,000 men,&mdash;he quickly moved
to Chancellorsville to meet Hooker with his tremendously
superior force.</p>

<p>The great Confederate had by this time completely
penetrated Hooker's plan of campaign. He had no
idea that the 8,500 men left in the works at and below
Fredericksburg could for long hold that position
against Sedgwick's superior force, but he knew the
quality of the men set to that task, and he confidently
reckoned that they would make such resistance&mdash;as
in fact they did&mdash;as to prevent Sedgwick from forming
a junction with the main army at Chancellorsville,
until the struggle there should be ended.</p>

<p>And what a struggle it promised to be! Lee knew
that at most he could hope for nothing better than to
oppose one man to Hooker's three but even against
such odds he decided to risk battle in the open rather
than attempt a hazardous and dispiriting retreat to
the defenses of Richmond.</p>

<p>Cautiously but rapidly, he transferred his army to
Chancellorsville and after baffling various Federal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
attempts to strike at his stores and communications,
he concentrated in Hooker's front quite all that he
could of his scanty force.</p>

<p>By this time Hooker's ceaseless activity had uncovered
all the fords above Fredericksburg, and
opened short and easy lines of communication,
through Falmouth opposite Fredericksburg, between
Sedgwick, operating on the east of Fredericksburg,
and Hooker's headquarters near Chancellorsville on
the southwest. Thus the two temporarily divided
wings of Hooker's army were brought again into
touch with each other and the whole vast force acted
as a unit under Hooker's command, while its disposition
was such as to compel Lee to divide his much
smaller force in preparation for the expected determined
assault of the Federals upon one or the
other of two faces&mdash;he could not know which.</p>

<p>But it was not Lee's purpose long to await attack.
His all-daring thought was to become himself the
assailant as soon as he could get his army corps disposed
in positions favorable to such a purpose.</p>

<p>He first selected a strong defensive position in
front of Chancellorsville and hurriedly fortified it as
a means of holding Hooker in check until he should
himself be ready to take the offensive.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, as his orders issued at that time
clearly show, Hooker regarded his campaign as already
completely successful. He had succeeded in
so enveloping Lee that that general, according to all
the rules of the war game must surrender either after
a show of fighting or without that bloody preliminary.</p>

<p>In these calculations Hooker had not sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
reckoned upon Lee's resourcefulness or his daring,
or the fighting qualities of the Army of Northern
Virginia. All these were factors underestimated in
his statement of the equation.</p>

<p>The position at Chancellorsville itself was a conspicuously
bad one for the Federals if they should
stand on the defensive, and Hooker, seeing this,
pushed his forces forward to more advantageous
ground, a movement which involved a good deal of
fighting in a comparatively small way, for the Confederates
not only resisted stoutly but manifested a
fiercely aggressive disposition wherever opportunity
offered for a fight.</p>

<p>For reasons that have never been disclosed Hooker
after a time withdrew his advance columns to their
old unfavorable position at Chancellorsville and
awaited his opportunity. His force was so greatly
superior to that of his adversary that there seemed
no risk in doing this, although it sacrificed a distinct
advantage. It was obvious that if Lee should make
a front attack he must be beaten off and crushed
while, with his already inferior force, it would be
simple madness, Hooker thought, for his opponent
to divide his army and attempt any flank movement
against an army outnumbering his own by three to
one.</p>

<p>That madness Lee deliberately adopted as his
strategy, and he carried it to a conclusion that must
always be an astonishment to the reader of history.</p>

<p>Hooker's extraordinary retirement from the front
of an enemy whom he had come out for the express
purpose of attacking in overwhelming force, has always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
been inexplicable. Why he shrank from the
attack after seeking opportunity for it with so much
energy and skill it is impossible to understand. Why
he abandoned his offensive operation just as its
culmination in victory seemed certain, and, with enormously
superior forces under his command fell back
and assumed the defensive in an unfavorable position,
even he seems never to have been able to explain.
The most masterful critic and historian who has written
of this campaign, says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>At this point Hooker faltered. Fighting Joe had reached
the culminating desire of his life. He had come face to
face with his foe, and he had a hundred and twenty thousand
eager and well-disciplined men at his back. He had come to
fight and he retreated without crossing <span class="locked">swords.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> Dodge's "The Campaign of Chancellorsville," p. 55.</p></div>

<p>This was the situation: Lee had had 59,000 men at
Fredericksburg. He had left 8,500 of them there
and had made other compulsory detachments which
reduced his fighting force in front of Hooker to no
more than 39,000. He confronted Hooker, who had
120,000 securely intrenched with 11,000 or 12,000
more within reach. Obviously Lee could not hope by
direct assault to carry the works and conquer a force
so overwhelming. Equally he could not hope to
stand on the defensive against an army which could
easily and certainly overlap both his flanks and
quickly crush him to a pulp. He must either retreat
or play a great and most hazardous game of strategy.</p>

<p>In consultation with Stonewall Jackson&mdash;the two
being seated upon cracker boxes abandoned in Hooker's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
retirement&mdash;it was decided to take a supreme risk
in face of a supreme danger. With 39,000 men facing
120,000, it was decided to divide the smaller army
and send Jackson, with 22,000 men upon an expedition,
the purpose of which was to strike like a lightning
flash at Hooker's right flank and rear, while
Lee, with the little remnant of his army, 17,000 in all,
should so far occupy Hooker in front as to prevent
him from detaching troops for the timely reinforcement
of his threatened wing.</p>

<p>The results that followed this operation have been
and still are a subject of bitter controversy. Hooker
tried afterwards to throw the blame for the disaster
which ensued upon Howard, Sickles and his other
lieutenants. They in turn disclaimed that responsibility
and insisted that the disaster was due solely to
Hooker's own orders and to his neglect of obvious
duty as commanding general. The skilled military
critics who have since written of the campaign have
taken one side or the other of this purely personal
controversy, according to their lights of knowledge,
or their darkenings of prejudice. These things belong
to biography. It is the function of the historian
merely to tell the story of what happened and to that
task alone the present writer addresses himself.</p>

<p>Lee and Jackson decided, as they sat there on the
cracker boxes, that Jackson, with 22,000 men, should
undertake to turn Hooker's right flank and assail him
in rear, while Lee with 17,000 men should fully occupy
him by a threat of front attack, and that if
Jackson's movement should succeed, his part of the
army should force its way to a junction with Lee.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
Failing that, the two parts of the army must of course
retreat in the not very confident hope of uniting again
at Gordonsville and together falling back to the defenses
of Richmond. For Stuart with the Confederate
cavalry had utterly broken up and defeated that
part of Hooker's plan which had contemplated
Stoneman's sweep to Hanover Court House and the
entrenching of his force there as an obstacle in the
way of Lee's retreat.</p>

<p>On Saturday, May 2, 1863, at daylight, or a little
before, Lee and Jackson began the execution of their
daring stratagem.</p>

<p>Hooker's headquarters were at Chancellorsville.
His line stretched eastward and northeastward to
the river and westward to a region of high ground unassailable
from the front, where his right lay "in the
air," in military phrase, that is to say with no natural
obstacle, such as a river or a mountain, to defend it.
It was Jackson's purpose to march westward on a
route parallel with Hooker's line, turn its western
end and strike it in flank and rear.</p>

<p>To accomplish that he must completely separate
his 22,000 men from Lee's 17,000 and take the
chances of battle for a reuniting of the two forces.</p>

<p>It took all day to make the march. All day Jackson
kept Stuart's cavalry between his column and the
enemy, feeling the enemy's lines to find out how they
were posted and what their strength was at every
point.</p>

<p>His march was clearly discovered to the Federal
troops, and fully reported to their commander,
Hooker. But it was completely misinterpreted. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
was believed to be the initiatory movement of that
retreat upon Richmond, which Hooker&mdash;master of
logistics that he was&mdash;thought that he had by his
maneuvers compelled Lee to undertake by way of
saving his little army from destruction.</p>

<p>While Jackson, with scarcely any disguise or concealment,
was marching along Hooker's front with
intent to turn his flank and strike him in rear, Hooker
rested easily in the conviction that his adversary, confronted
by an irresistible force, was retreating upon
Richmond either by way of Culpeper or by the Gordonsville
route.</p>

<p>In this belief Hooker broke the continuity of his
own lines by throwing forward a part of his forces to
assail Jackson's moving column in flank and rear, but
he made no effort to advance from Chancellorsville
upon Lee's manifestly depleted force in front or in
any vigorous way to push a column in between Lee
and Jackson. He fought Lee on the skirmish lines
all day, but he made no determined attempt to run
over the skirmish lines and find out what was behind
them. In other words he suffered himself to be completely
and disastrously deceived by that tapping at
his own lines which Lee ceaselessly kept up by way of
misleading him.</p>

<p>As he knew Lee's strength almost to a man, and as
he was fully and frequently informed during the day
concerning the extent to which Jackson's detachment
had weakened it, it is difficult to understand why he
did not end the struggle then and there by hurling
three men to one against Lee on the one hand and
against Jackson on the other, and crushing them
separately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
Here was another illustration and proof of the fact
that the Federal administration at Washington had
not yet found a general fit to command the superb
Army of the Potomac. The opportunity at Chancellorsville
was the very greatest and completest that
was at any time during the war offered to a commanding
general on either side to make a quick and
complete end of the struggle.</p>

<p>Under like circumstances a Grant or a Sherman
would have hurled 40,000 or 50,000 men upon Lee
and an equal number upon Jackson, meanwhile employing
a lesser but quite sufficient force in keeping
the two wings of the Confederate army divided beyond
the possibility of reunion. But it is conceivable
at least that if Lee had been confronting a Grant or
a Sherman, he would never have risked so dangerous
a division of his inferior force. The character of the
adversary's commanding general is a factor in every
military problem, upon which a strategist must
reckon as carefully as he does upon the number of
that adversary's men or guns.</p>

<p>However that may be, Lee had divided his meager
force in the presence of an enemy who greatly outnumbered
him, and Hooker took no effective account
of the fact. He did not strengthen his own right
wing while Jackson was marching around it to assail
it in the rear. He took no effective measures either
to assail Jackson on his threatening march or to fall
upon Lee in front in crushingly overwhelming force.
He was content to beat off Lee's pretended attacks
in front and to neglect Jackson's movement as very
certainly a retreat with which he had not energy
enough to interfere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
As a result Jackson succeeded in turning the
Federal right flank, and at six o'clock in the evening
the great Confederate flanker fell like a thunderbolt
upon the rear of Hooker's divisions on the right.</p>

<p>Without skirmishers to give warning of his coming
Jackson pushed his columns through the woods and
the tangled underbrush. So eager were the Confederates
in their work that their divisions, thrown into
separate lines for the forward movement, pushed after
each other until the several lines became a single
mass of humanity pressing forward, each man striving
to get in front of his fellow and be first to fall
upon the foe.</p>

<p>Jackson knew his men too well to doubt them for
a moment, and he therefore rushed them forward to
the assault without any of those precautions which
the books of tactics prescribe. He threw out no skirmishers
to feel the way. He sent no company in advance
to ascertain the enemy's disposition. He
simply hurled his force upon that of the foe, striking
as the tempest does, without warning.</p>

<p>The first intimation Hooker's men had of their
enemy's advance came to them in a rush of deer,
grouse and other game that had been disturbed and
was fleeing through the tangled woodlands before the
on-coming mass of armed and belligerent humanity.
And before wonder over this rush of animals, serpents
and birds had satisfied itself, Jackson's men,
nine deep, fell upon the unsuspecting Federals at
supper, and swept like a hurricane through their
camps and over their lines.</p>

<p>Then occurred the second great panic of the war,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
in which men fell into such fear as to lose all semblance
of soldierly self-control, and in which military
cohesion was completely dissipated. Here and there
a brigade or a regiment or a company of Federals
bravely stood its ground, but the great mass of that
German army corps commanded by men of unpronounceable
names which had been extensively advertised
as intending to show Americans how to fight,
fell into hopeless confusion, broke ranks and ran to
whatever cover the fugitives could find. Jackson
ran over their lines, possessed himself of their defenses,
captured their arms and their suppers and
completely telescoped the left wing of Hooker's
army.</p>

<p>Night alone saved the rest of it. For panic is more
contagious than smallpox and, in view of what happened
afterwards, it is safe to say that but for the
coming of night the panic which so suddenly reduced
the right wing of Hooker's force to a mass of fugitives,
would quickly have spread throughout the army.</p>

<p>But night called a halt and Jackson's men rested
upon their arms, ready to renew their victorious
progress with the dawn of day. According to a competent
and adverse <span class="locked">witness<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span> these men of Jackson's
command were "the best infantry in existence, as
tough, hardy and full of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élan</i>, as they are ill-fed, ill-clothed,
and ill-looking."</p>

of Chancellorsville," p. 92.</p></div>

<p>But a great calamity was in store for the Confederates
that evening. Stonewall Jackson was
mortally wounded by his own men acting under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
orders of his own giving, while he was making his
preparations for the completion of his wonderful
work on the following morning. Except in the possible
death of Lee, no greater loss could have befallen
the Southern arms. The destruction of a division or
even of an army corps would have been a trifling disaster
in comparison. For upon Jackson as upon no
other man, Lee depended for the masterful execution
of his plans, and equally for wise counsel and daring
initiative. The soldiers of the army, too, had come
to look upon the great lieutenant as the one man invincible,
and to regard whatever work he might assign
them to do as a task that must be accomplished at all
costs and all hazards. In the doing of his bidding,
the officers and men alike were accustomed to think
of their orders as the decrees of an all-wise Providence
and of themselves as mere instruments set to
accomplish the purposes of a higher authority. No
man among them questioned the wisdom of Jackson's
plans or doubted the possibility of doing whatsoever
he had ordered them to do. In such mood as
that which their reverent love for Jackson inspired
in them, those incomparable fighters were capable of
well-nigh any achievement.</p>

<p>When it was whispered through the army that
Stonewall Jackson was wounded unto death there
was mourning and distress at every bivouac fire, and
depressing sorrow in every soldierly heart. But
there was no thought of failure or faltering in the
work to be done on the morrow. That work had been
marked out for them by Stonewall Jackson himself,
and every man of them was resolved to do it or fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
fighting in a determined endeavor to accomplish to
the uttermost limit of possibility the will of the fallen
chieftain.</p>

<p>The command fell upon J.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B.  Stuart and after
sustaining a midnight assault upon the Confederate
flank by Sickles, which was repulsed with comparative
ease, Stuart was prepared, early on Sunday
morning, to press forward with the entire detachment
and force a junction with Lee in front of Chancellorsville,
after destroying or driving into retreat all
of Hooker's forces that lay west of that point.</p>

<p>There was terrific fighting at every step. There
were formidable breastworks to be assailed and
carried, and they were protected by difficult abattis in
front. There were superbly served batteries at every
defensive point with determined infantry in support.
But the men who had been Jackson's yesterday, and
were to-day under the dare-devil leadership of Stuart,
remembered that Jackson had planned this movement
and they were death-resolute to carry it to completion.
They pressed forward always. A "fire of
hell" meant no more to them than a summer breeze.
In face of canister and a murderous fire of musketry,
they plunged onward with no thought of hesitation
or shrinking.</p>

<p>Jackson lay under a tree somewhere, wounded unto
death, but it was Jackson still whom these heroic fellows
were serving; it was in obedience to his orders
and in execution of his plans that they were advancing,
and their inspiration of resoluteness had for one
of its elements a mad resentment of Jackson's
wounds, as an injury for which the enemy must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
made to pay the blood atonement of those old Scriptures
in whose words Jackson so devoutly and reverently
believed.</p>

<p>Probably never before or since in battle did men
fight with a madder impulse than did this "best infantry
in existence" on that Sunday morning, in
execution of their stricken leader's purpose. They
were very maniacs, filled with fury, assailing the
enemy at every point with truly demoniacal determination,
reinforced by all the strength and skill that
long discipline and battle-habit could give to men
with arms in their hands.</p>

<p>In spite of numbers, in the face of obstacles that
would have appalled the best battalions in any
European army, these grief-stricken worshipers of
the great leader, swept forward as the hurricane does,
regardless of all obstacles and absolutely resistless in
their onward progress.</p>

<p>Their impulse was indicated by the battle cry,
"Charge and remember Jackson!" which was continually
passed up and down the lines by word of
mouth throughout the day, by men with set teeth and
lips compressed to paleness.</p>

<p>Early in the morning it was Stuart's thought to
refresh some of his troops who had been long without
food. He ordered an issue of rations and a pause for
breakfast, meantime directing a small advance in
order to rectify the line at a defective point. The
men rushed forward with such impetuosity, abandoning
rations and taking the bloody work of war in lieu
of breakfast, that Stuart decided to let them have
their way and bring on at once the action for which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
had been his thought to prepare them by a feeding.
The incident is valuably illustrative of the temper in
which that Sunday's fight was undertaken, a fight
decisive for the time, and ending as it did in the defeat
and overthrow of the largest, strongest, and most
perfectly equipped army that had ever been assembled
on this continent, by a force one third or one
fourth its number, ill-fed, ill-clothed and exceedingly
ill-looking, as Colonel Dodge has testified in print.</p>

<p>Here it is necessary to make an important distinction,
which is often overlooked. When troops are
beaten by an adversary having inferior numbers, the
fault is not always or even usually with the men.
It lies almost always with commanding officers who,
through error or incapacity or otherwise, fail to
bring the men into such positions as may render their
superiority of numbers effective. At Chancellorsville
Hooker had quite all of three men to Lee's one&mdash;and
including Sedgwick's force his odds were even
greater than that. On the part of the so-called German
corps there seems to have been a distinct inferiority
of soldierly quality, while Jackson's men,
according to the expert judgment of Colonel Dodge,
supported by that of General Hooker, were "the best
infantry in existence." But between the men generally
of the two armies there was no such superiority
on the one side and inferiority on the other as to offset
the enormous disparity of numbers and thus to
account for the result.</p>

<p>The difficulty was that in the great war game Lee
was immeasurably more than Hooker's master. At
every point he so handled his forces as to bewilder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
and embarrass his enemy. In spite of his inferiority
in numbers he managed at many points, by deft maneuvering,
to assail Hooker's divisions, with more men
than they could for the moment bring to bear in
resistance.</p>

<p>In reviewing great battles and campaigns it is important
to bear these things in mind, and, for the
credit of a brave soldiery, to remember that all dispositions
of troops are made by men higher up. The
skill and alertness of those men higher up, or their
lack of skill and alertness, determines whether or not
due advantage is to be taken of numbers, the nature
of the ground and other adventitious circumstances
upon which the outcome of battles in a large measure
depends.</p>

<p>At Chancellorsville, for example, there was one
position so favorable that the artillery of either army,
posted there upon the crest of a commanding hill,
could work havoc in the ranks of its adversary. The
Federals held that position when night fell on Saturday.
They unwisely abandoned it during the night
and early in the morning Stuart, always quick to see
and alert to seize advantage, occupied it with thirty
guns too strongly supported to be dislodged. In like
manner the superior generalship of the Confederates
at other points enabled them often to bring two men
to bear against one in spite of their general inferiority
of numbers.</p>

<p>When Hooker found his right wing crushed and
reduced to a panic-stricken mass of fugitives, he still
had the battle in his own hands and victory easily
within his grasp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
After Jackson's blow was delivered on Saturday
evening Hooker could not have doubted that Lee's
little army of less than forty thousand men had been
divided in his front. It was his obvious and easy task
to keep it divided and to crush its two parts separately.
He had already thrust Sickles in between Lee
and Jackson, and in order to maintain the separation
he had only overwhelmingly to reinforce Sickles, an
enterprising officer. This he might easily have done
by drawing troops from his completely unemployed
left wing which stretched away superfluously to the
fords of the river with no enemy at all in front.</p>

<p>The war problem was simple and easy at that time,
and had Hooker been a man of masterful mind, he
must have wrought it out to checkmate within twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>But it is to be remembered that Lee knew all old
army officers, and knew the capacity and temper of
every commander sent to oppose him. It is probable
that had Hooker been a man of masterful mind, Lee
would never have attempted the strategy which
created this opportunity.</p>

<p>Let us leave speculation for facts. Hooker had
unaccountably abandoned his brilliant offensive movement
at the crowning moment when its success, complete
and decisive, seemed certain. Having come out
to force Lee to a fight in the open, he had shrunk
from the conflict. Having skilfully and brilliantly
so maneuvered as to place himself on the flank of
Lee's army with intent to assail and overwhelm his
adversary, he had suddenly shrunk back, as if appalled,
into a defensive attitude and had left it to Lee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
to determine when and where and how the further
fighting should be done. Having advanced from
Chancellorsville into the more favorable country beyond,
he had quite inexplicably fallen back to Chancellorsville
again and fortified there as if he had been
confronted by an adversary of superior strength, and
when he clearly saw that Lee had divided his inferior
force, he had over-confidently assumed that retreat
was intended instead of a blow.</p>

<p>But even after the blow had been delivered, with
staggering effect, Hooker had the war game in his
own hands. It was his obvious policy to order fifty
or sixty thousand men or more from his unemployed
left wing, to Chancellorsville, to fall destructively
upon each of Lee's widely separated detachments,
with the purpose of crushing them both.</p>

<p>He did nothing of the kind. Instead he stood upon
the defensive against Lee in front and Stuart upon
his flank, and utterly failing to prevent a junction between
these two he retired still further and stood upon
the defensive again to receive their joint assault.</p>

<p>In the meantime he had unemployed troops in
vastly superior numbers, lying idly upon his left.
Instead of ordering them into the conflict he waited
for Sedgwick, who was coming up after driving the
Confederates out of their works at Fredericksburg,
to save him from defeat and disaster.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, and for lack of the reinforcements
which he had failed to send to the firing line,
the Confederates had won a great victory, reuniting
their divided army and completely driving Hooker
from the defensive position which he had taken up at
Chancellorsville.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
Stuart's hurricane-like advance, begun early in the
morning, resulted long before noonday, not only in
effecting the desired junction between the two separated
portions of the Confederate Army, but also
in the compulsory retirement of Hooker's army from
the entire Chancellorsville line and its retreat toward
the river.</p>

<p>The fighting by which all this was accomplished
has been wonderfully well described in summary, by
Colonel Dodge, in his admirably complete and impartial
history of this campaign. A quotation from
that work seems a quite sufficient showing-forth of
what was done, with equal justice to the heroism of
the men on both sides of the terrible conflict. Colonel
Dodge writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There can be no limit to the praise earned by the mettlesome
veterans of Jackson's corps, in the deadly fight at
Fairview. They had continuously marched and fought with
little sleep and less rations, since Thursday morning [till
Sunday]. Their ammunition had been sparse, and they had
been obliged to rely frequently upon the bayonet alone. They
had fought under circumstances which rendered all attempts
to preserve organization impossible. They had charged
through woods against well-constructed fieldworks and in
the teeth of destructive artillery fire, and had captured the
works again and again. Never had infantry better earned
the right to rank with the best which ever bore arms than
this gallant twenty thousand&mdash;one man in every four of
whom lay bleeding on the field. Nor can the same meed of
praise be withheld from our own brave legions. Our losses
had been heavier than those of the enemy. Generals and
regimental commanders had fallen in equal proportions. Our
forces had, owing to the extraordinary combinations of the
general in command, been outnumbered by the enemy wherever
engaged.... Well may the soldiers who were engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
in this bloody encounter of Sunday, May 3, 1863, call to
mind with equal pride, that each met a foeman worthy of his
steel.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is in this spirit that the present historian desires
to write of the events of that time, forty odd years
agone. All the military skill, all the heroism, all the
personal courage that marked the events of that
struggle, whether upon the one side or upon the
other, is a part of our common American heritage of
glory. For these men who fought each other so gallantly
and with such heroic determination, were all
Americans, and to all of them Americans owe the
tribute of admiration.</p>

<p>After all these years the memory of their gallant
deeds will be cherished by the whole Republic and all
its people, whether the heroism of daring and endurance
was shown on the one side or on the other. The
men who met in battle there were fighting on the
one side and on the other for liberty. Their views differed
as to what would best minister to liberty, but
their purpose was the same. The questions that
divided them were long ago settled, and they no
longer vex the Republic. The time has come when we
may rejoice as citizens of one country in the devotion
and courage that animated both sides in that great
struggle for the decision of questions that could be
settled only by the arbitrament of arms.</p>

<p>On Sunday, before noon, Hooker was completely
driven from the Chancellorsville line and compelled
to retire to a new position of extraordinary strength.
Lee, with an army much smaller and considerably disorganized,
but inspirited by repeated victory, confronted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
him. It was Lee's purpose to move again to
the assault, in the conviction that the delivery of another
of his tremendous blows would result in breaking
Hooker's resistance and driving him across the
river. It is true that Hooker still had a vastly superior
force, but events had clearly shown that the
Federal commander did not know how to handle his
superior forces in a way to make the most of their
superiority. Lee confidently believed that even with
his smaller numbers he could deliver a blow that
would drive his adversary out of the new lines as his
previous assaults had already driven him out of the
old ones.</p>

<p>The new position taken up by the Army of the
Potomac is described by an engineer officer of high
authority as "well-nigh impregnable," and the Army
of Northern Virginia was very nearly worn out with
the work it had done in conquering the former situation.
But it was Lee's habit of mind to do and dare,
and he had sufficiently tried conclusions now, to know
beyond all question, that in the war game he was
immeasurably more than Hooker's match.</p>

<p>So about noon on Sunday he began feeling of
Hooker's new lines, searching for the most favorable
point at which to hurl himself upon them in the hope
of breaking them and driving his enemy into final
retreat. For Lee's strategy no longer had any element
of defensive purpose in it. He was no longer
thinking of defense indeed or of securing lines of retreat.
It was his bold thought to assail Hooker and
destroy him with all his superior forces, or at the very
least to drive him back across the river and take into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
his own keeping the problem of where and how the
campaigning of 1863 should be done. Says Colonel
<span class="locked">Dodge:<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> "The Campaign of Chancellorsville," p. 156.</p></div>

<blockquote>

<p>Hooker still had in line at Chancellorsville, counting out
his losses of Saturday, over eighty-five thousand men. Lee
had not exceeding half the number. But every musket borne
by the Army of Northern Virginia was put to good use;
every round of ammunition was made to tell its story. On
the other hand of the effective of the Army of the Potomac,
barely a quarter was fought <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">au fond</i>, while at least one half
the force for duty was given no opportunity to burn a
cartridge to aid in checking the onset of the elated champions
of the South.</p></blockquote>

<p>So much for disparity in generalship. The South
had found its great and masterful commander, who
knew how to utilize to the utmost such forces as were
placed at his disposal. Mr. Lincoln had not yet
found a general capable of employing to the full
measure of its capacity, the superb army which the
North had created by a lavish expenditure of treasure
and by the eager volunteering of Northern youth for
their country's service. Ulysses S. Grant was still
the subordinate of Halleck and the Army of the
Potomac was commanded by a general utterly unequal
to the task of holding his own in a contest with
Robert E. Lee.</p>

<p>In his new position Hooker stood upon the defensive
and appealed to Sedgwick, who held the position
below Fredericksburg, to come to his rescue and save
him from disaster.</p>

<p>Sedgwick responded promptly, as it was his custom
to do, though the task set him was a difficult one. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
must assail Lee's works at Fredericksburg, drive out
the 8,500 confident Confederates who were holding
the trenches there, and then by a march of some weary
miles fall upon Lee's right and rear, thus rescuing
Hooker from the peril of the great Confederate's
persistent assaults.</p>

<p>A whole library of controversial literature has been
written in conflicting efforts to show who was to
blame for the failure of Sedgwick to relieve Hooker
in time to save him from the vengeance of Lee. With
that controversy the present narrative of facts in no
way concerns itself. Let us simply tell what happened.</p>

<p>Already in command of an available force twice
as great as Lee's, Hooker, driven from his chosen
line, had fallen back to a more concentrated one.
Finding Lee disposed, with one man to his two, to
assail him on this new line, he called upon Sedgwick
as already stated, to come to his relief, against enormous
obstacles. The order was received late at night.
Its execution required a complete change in Sedgwick's
dispositions, which had been made with the entirely
different purpose of cutting off Lee's retreat
after Hooker should have broken the Confederate
resistance at Chancellorsville. So far from breaking
that resistance Hooker had been forced to yield to it
and retire before it.</p>

<p>Sedgwick changed front, drove Lee's 8,500 men
out of the works at Fredericksburg, and pushed on
to assail Lee's flank. Lee detached, to meet him, all
of his small force except the Jackson corps of 19,000
men, with which he undertook, personally, to hold in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
check any movement that Hooker might make with
the 80,000 or more of hardened veterans whom the
Federal commander had under his immediate orders.
But Hooker made no determined movement. On
Sunday a fierce battle was fought between Sedgwick
and those of Lee's forces which were engaged in trying
to check his movement. It ended in the Confederates
holding their ground and defeating Sedgwick's
purpose of coming to the relief of his commander.</p>

<p>Early on Monday morning the Confederates succeeded
in reoccupying the Fredericksburg Heights
in Sedgwick's rear, which left him, in case of defeat,
with no course open to him except to retreat across
the river and give up the contest.</p>

<p>To compel this the Confederates, falling upon him
at six o'clock in the evening, pressed him at every
point while Hooker, with the main body of the Federal
army, lay quite inert in rear of Chancellorsville.
Soon after nightfall Sedgwick crossed the river, leaving
the Confederates in full possession of the Fredericksburg
Heights and of all the region east of the
fords upon which Hooker depended for retreat in
case of necessity.</p>

<p>Lee next set about the task of compelling that retreat.
With full confidence in the willingness and the
abundant ability of his men to respond to any demand
he might make upon them for activity, he quickly
ordered the reinforcements with which he had
strengthened his right wing for the day's work, to
return, and with the bulk of his force thus reunited,
after having disposed of Sedgwick he was ready to
fall upon Hooker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
During these operations against Sedgwick Lee's
army had been for the second time divided. A great
part of it had been sent half a dozen miles or more
away to force Sedgwick back to the river and across it.
In the meanwhile Lee, with a mere fragment of his
force, had lain in front of Hooker. Why Hooker did
not fall upon him and destroy him with the eighty
thousand men whom he could easily have brought to
bear against less than twenty thousand, is a question
that can be answered only by the reminder that
Hooker was not equal to the task of successfully
handling the marvelous fighting machine which the
North had so successfully created. Great as he was
as a fighter under some other and abler man's direction,
Hooker in command of 120,000 men seems to
have been paralyzed by the magnitude of his task. He
left it to Lee, with his greatly smaller force to determine
when and where the fighting should be done. He
lay still and let Lee alone while the greater part of
Lee's army was detached upon the mission of driving
Sedgwick across the river and recapturing the
heights at Fredericksburg. He lay still while Lee
was bringing back the troops thus detached and putting
himself in readiness to strike that final blow that
should break the Federal lines, drive them back
across the river, and make an inglorious end of
Hooker's superbly planned but phenomenally ill-executed
campaign.</p>

<p>On Monday, May 4, he had 80,000 men (Dodge)
under his immediate command at Chancellorsville,
with more than 20,000 under Sedgwick within easy
call, as an available reinforcement. At the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
most Lee could bring less than 30,000 to bear against
him even if every movement in concentration should
be successfully made. Yet according to his own testimony,
given two years later, Hooker decided on
Monday to retreat across the river. He called his
major generals together "not as a council of war" he
says in his testimony, but merely to find out how they
felt with regard to the alternative policy of making
what Hooker himself regarded as "a desperate move
against the enemy in our front." That "desperate
move" was the assailing of less than 30,000 men by
more than 80,000 of as good soldiers as ever pulled
a trigger, while 20,000 more remained within call as
reinforcements.</p>

<p>It was decided by Hooker, against the nearly
unanimous advice of his lieutenants not to make that
"desperate move," and the history of war records no
more lame and impotent conclusion than that. It
was decided by Hooker that the great army which
had made a splendid strategic movement for the purpose
of fighting Lee in the open and destroying him
by overwhelming numbers, should run away from
him and escape beyond the river if he should graciously
permit it to do so.</p>

<p>To that end&mdash;to render possible the escape of
80,000 resolute men from the assault of less than
30,000 of the enemy, all the engineering skill that the
Army of the Potomac could command was brought
to bear. It protected the roads with abattis and the
bridge heads with batteries which the aggressively
insistent Confederates shelled persistently. A sudden
rise in the river for a time threatened the retreat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
with failure and placed a part of the force in danger
of destruction or capture. But in the end Hooker
succeeded in extricating his army from its position.
Early on the morning of May 6, the last battalions of
the Army of the Potomac withdrew across the river.</p>

<p>Thus ended in failure the most brilliantly planned
attempt that had yet been made to destroy Confederate
resistance, conquer the Confederate capital and
make a mercifully early end of a fratricidal war of
stupendous proportions.</p>

<p>Hooker reported his losses during the campaign at
17,285 men; Lee's loss was 12,277.</p>

<p>If Lee could have attacked Hooker's fleeing columns
when they were huddled together at the bridge
ends on the river, demoralized and without organization
as they were, he might easily have multiplied the
Federal loss in killed, wounded, and prisoners by two
or three. General Schurz once expressed to the present
historian his astonishment that Lee neglected to
do this. Perhaps the best answer is given in an
extract from Colonel Dodge's exhaustive history of
the conflict. He writes that Lee "was doubtless
profoundly grateful that the Army of the Potomac
should retire across the Rappahannock and leave
his troops to the hard-earned rest they needed so
much more than ourselves; but little thanks are due
to Hooker, who was, it seems, on the north side of
the river during these critical moments that the
casualties of the campaign were not doubled by a final
assault on the part of Lee while we lay in this perilous
situation.... Providentially the artillery of the
Army of Northern Virginia had expended almost its
last round of ammunition previous to this time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
Thus accident alone saved the rear of Hooker's defeated
army from a disaster and demoralization comparable
with that of Manassas, at a time when, in the
urgently expressed opinion of General Sickles, the
conspicuous rout of the Army of the Potomac would
necessarily have meant the abandonment of the
struggle by the North. "If," he alleged, "this army
should be destroyed, it would be the last one the
country would raise."</p>

<p>Hooker had lost, by his own incapacity, a decisive
opportunity to end the war with Federal success, and
Lee, because of a lack of ammunition, had lost a still
more obvious opportunity to end it by a decisive triumph
of the Confederate arms.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Gettysburg Campaign</span></span></h2>

<p>When the campaign of Chancellorsville ended in
defeat for the Federals, the two armies returned to
their former positions at Fredericksburg, confronting
each other with a river between&mdash;a river which
neither of them was for the time being disposed to
cross with fighting intent.</p>

<p>Hooker, as his orders issued at that time showed,
was content as McClellan had been the year before,
that he had saved his great army from disastrous defeat
and capture. He was glad to escape with what
remained of his army from a position which he had
brilliantly achieved in the confident expectation of
there completely crushing Lee, compelling his surrender,
and marching unopposed into Richmond.
His escape had been a very narrow one, made possible
only by the exhaustion of the Confederate ammunition,
but at any rate he had escaped, and he was
disposed to congratulate himself on that.</p>

<p>Lee, on the other hand had good reason to be satisfied
with the results of his work. With one man to
his enemy's three he had so brilliantly maneuvered as
to strike his foe at each point with a superior force; he
had, by virtue of superior genius alone inflicted disaster
upon an army vastly greater than his own in
numbers, and possessed of commanding strategic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
positions; he had beaten that army in a succession of
battles, and driven it into hurried and uncertain retreat;
he had saved Richmond and again made himself
master of the military situation.</p>

<p>His army needed rest after its arduous work, and
to give it rest he lay still for some weeks.</p>

<p>But in the meanwhile he did not lose sight of that
supreme purpose which had inspired him from the
beginning of his career as the commander of the
Army of Northern Virginia. That purpose was to
transfer the seat of war northward, to press the
enemy, to protect Richmond by putting Washington
on its defense.</p>

<p>There were special reasons for the adoption of this
policy now. Operations at the West had been disastrous
and discouraging to the Confederates. Their
armies had been driven out of Kentucky and Tennessee.
The fall of Island Number Ten and Memphis
a little later in the northern reaches of the Mississippi
and Farragut's capture of New Orleans at its southern
end had left the Southerners only a small hold
upon the great river at Vicksburg, Port Hudson and
the space between. Grant was insistently hammering
at Vicksburg, with every prospect of soon capturing
that key to the river and completely cutting
the Confederacy in twain. But if Lee could capture
Washington or compel its evacuation by pushing himself
into its rear and perhaps seizing upon Baltimore,
Philadelphia and New York, the disasters at
the West would count for nothing in the reckoning.
Europe at least would accept the successful invasion
of the North and the conquest of its capital as events<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
decisive of the war in behalf of the South; and
European intervention was still the one thing most
dreaded at the North and most ardently hoped for at
the South.</p>

<p>Again there was a strong party at the North, embracing
a minority so great that a small influence
might easily convert it into a majority, which was opposed
to the war in every way and bitterly antagonistic
to the Lincoln administration. That party held
the war upon the seceding states to be wrong, wicked
and without adequate constitutional warrant. It contended
also that the conduct of the war had been
recklessly wasteful of life and treasure, and that in
point of fact it had failed of its purpose. In support
of this view the people opposed to Mr. Lincoln cited
the Manassas panic, the defeat of McClellan before
Richmond, the utter overthrow of Pope, the drawn
battle at Sharpsburg, the defeat of Burnside at
Fredericksburg, and finally the all-conspicuous defeat
of Hooker at Chancellorsville. If Lee could add to
such a list of achievements the conquest of Washington
or Philadelphia or if he could win a great battle
anywhere north of the Potomac, this minority of protesting
and complaining malcontents at the North,
must be quickly converted into an overwhelming majority,
clamorous for the ending of the war by the
concession of all that the Confederates demanded.</p>

<p>Still another influence had its bearing upon Lee's
mind. His army, after its experiences in the Seven
Days' battles, in the second Manassas campaign, at
Antietam, at Fredericksburg, and finally in the campaign
of Chancellorsville, had come to regard itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
as absolutely invincible when led by Robert E. Lee.
It was ready and more than ready for any enterprise
that he might direct it to undertake. It believed in
itself. Still more confidently it believed in Lee. It
wanted to fight. It was restlessly eager for whatever
Lee might prescribe of daring and endurance. Probably
there was never an army, great or small, whose
spirit gave to its leader a stronger inducement to desperate
endeavor. Those men wanted war. They
courted battle. They welcomed hardship, exposure,
fatigue, starvation&mdash;if only at the end of it all they
might come face to face with the enemy, under the
leadership of Lee.</p>

<p>A skilled military critic on the Northern side has
characterized them as the best soldiers on earth. The
phrase is not an extravagant one, as every close student
of the Confederate war must clearly see, and
their spirit meant more to the enlightened mind of
Lee than a hundred guns and a score of infantry divisions
could have signified.</p>

<p>There was still another fact to be taken into account.
Under the mistaken system of short-term
enlistments which had been adopted at the North,
more than thirty thousand of Hooker's best and most
seasoned soldiers were about this time going home.
Enlistments at the North had well-nigh ceased under
the discouragement of repeated failure, while at the
South the conscription law&mdash;extended as to age&mdash;had
resulted in putting pretty nearly every able-bodied
white man in all that region into the army. The
Army of Northern Virginia was being rapidly
swelled in numbers, while the Army of the Potomac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
was losing many of its best fighting regiments and
brigades. The Army of Northern Virginia was
flushed by recent and conspicuous victory; the Army
of the Potomac was sadly disheartened by a defeat
which, in view of its vast superiority in numbers, it
could in no wise account for or understand. The
Army of Northern Virginia had unbounded confidence
in itself and limitless belief in its commander;
the Army of the Potomac had no longer any reason
to trust itself, and it had utterly lost confidence in the
general who had so badly handled it as to subject it
to humiliating defeat where it had justly expected to
achieve victory quick, certain and decisive.</p>

<p>Moved by these considerations Lee at once planned
a new invasion of the region north of the Potomac.
The enemy confronting him was still superior in numbers,
equipment and everything else except spirit and
fighting quality and its general. It would not do for
Lee to move northward, leaving that army in his rear
with full opportunity to destroy his communications,
rush upon Richmond and possess the Confederate
capital. He must so maneuver as to compel Hooker
to fall back upon Washington, precisely as he had
done in McClellan's case the year before.</p>

<p>Again he successfully played upon the excessive
concern felt at the North for the safety of Washington.
Having brought Longstreet with two strong
divisions from the south side of the James river for
his reinforcement, and having brought up every battery
and battalion that could be spared from any
other position, Lee played again the game he had
played against McClellan. While still strongly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
securely holding his position at Fredericksburg, he
began detaching forces in a way to threaten Washington
with an attack in the rear, and to compel
Hooker to retire upon the national capital for its defense.</p>

<p>First he sent Stuart with his splendid cavalry to
Culpeper Court House. Then, a little later, he sent
Ewell's and Longstreet's corps to the same point, retaining
only A.&nbsp;P.  Hill's corps to hold the works at
Fredericksburg. Should Hooker deem this an opportunity
and seek to seize it, it would require fully
three days at the very least for him to lay pontoon
bridges and push a column across the river for purposes
of assault. In the event of such a demonstration
two days would amply suffice Lee to bring his
two detached corps back to the works at Fredericksburg,
there to defend them irresistibly. Hooker was
much too discreet a general not to see this, and so he
undertook no crossing of the river.</p>

<p>Lee was thus left in complete control of the military
situation. The transfer of two of his army
corps to Culpeper was a threat to Washington and
Washington promptly responded&mdash;as Lee intended
that it should do&mdash;by calling upon Hooker for the
retirement of his army for the defense of the National
capital.</p>

<p>Hooker ordered all his cavalry, under Pleasanton,
to move against and assail the Confederate horsemen
under Stuart at or near Culpeper. The two forces
met at Brandy Station, where for the first time in
the history of the Confederate War a strictly cavalry
contest of great proportions ensued. The Confederates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
had distinctly the better of it. They repelled
the assault, with losses about equal on either side, and
left the Federals with no further information as to
the Confederate movement than they had had before
the action. As the acquisition of such information
was precisely all that Pleasanton had fought to secure,
it must be reckoned that he had failed in his purpose.
But he had at any rate proved that the Federal
cavalry men had at last learned how to ride their
horses, an art in which they had proved themselves
distinctly inferior to the Confederates in all previous
conflicts between horsemen of the two sides.</p>

<p>On the thirteenth of June Ewell's corps was in the
Valley of the Shenandoah marching northward; Hill
was still holding the entrenchments at Fredericksburg,
while Longstreet was in a position near Culpeper,
from which he could reinforce either at will.</p>

<p>Hooker had by this time recovered the sanity which
he had so completely lost during the campaign of
Chancellorsville and he at once asked permission of
Washington to push the whole of his vastly superior
force in between the separated fragments of Lee's
army and destroy them in detail. This was obviously
the right thing to do, but Halleck was still in supreme
control at Washington, and Hooker, by his phenomenal
failure at Chancellorsville, had justly lost Halleck's
confidence. Moreover Lee knew all about this
situation, and, knowing Halleck quite as well as he
knew Hooker, he was reckoning upon that general's
character.</p>

<p>Halleck forbade Hooker to make the bold move he
proposed, precisely as Lee had expected him to do,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
and Lee was thus left free to direct the course of the
campaign as he pleased.</p>

<p>Hooker, under orders, retired toward Washington,
leaving Lee free to add Hill's corps to the forces
with which he was advancing northward.</p>

<p>Ewell swept down the valley and assailed Winchester,
where he completely broke and destroyed
Milroy's force of ten thousand men, capturing four
thousand of them and driving the rest into disorderly
retreat upon Harper's Ferry.</p>

<p>Lee promptly threw Hill's corps into the Shenandoah
Valley, while Longstreet moved northward upon
parallel lines, east of the mountains.</p>

<p>Presently the Confederate cavalry crossed the
Potomac and reached Chambersburg in Pennsylvania.
The infantry and artillery promptly followed,
and by the twenty-second or twenty-third of June,
the whole Confederate army was in Pennsylvania&mdash;threatening
Washington, threatening Baltimore,
threatening Philadelphia, and gravely menacing even
New York.</p>

<p>A great panic ensued among the Northern people,
to whom the fact of war had not often before been
brought home in this intimate and terrifying fashion.
Women and children fled as refugees. Horses and
cattle were driven away into hiding. Silverware and
jewels were hastily buried, and all food stuffs that
could be carried away were hidden. For the first
time the people at the North had some small realization
of what war means to those who dwell in an invaded
country. They suffered no such desolation as
that which for years overspread northern Virginia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
They learned no such lesson of havoc as that which
Sheridan afterwards mercilessly taught the people of
that fruitful valley of Virginia over which, after his
desolating march, he picturesquely said that "the
crow that flies must carry his rations with him." But
at the least they learned that to a people whose land
is invaded, war is truly "all hell," in General Sherman's
phrase.</p>

<p>There was a hurried calling out of militia in the
threatened states, quite as if militia could be expected
to stand against the veterans who had fought at Richmond,
at Antietam, at Fredericksburg and at Chancellorsville.
Half a million of militia, if so many
could have been brought together, would have been
able to oppose no obstacle to the determined will of
such veteran soldiers as these. At that stage of the
war, the militia and raw, untrained volunteers on
either side, had ceased to be regarded as forces to be
reckoned with.</p>

<p>A more important fact was that Hooker was moving
with his veteran army to meet Lee, keeping himself
always between the great Confederate and the
National capital.</p>

<p>Again as during the former invasion, there were
eleven thousand Federal troops holding Harper's
Ferry. Again, as a year before, the general commanding
the Army of the Potomac wanted to save
them to his army by ordering them to evacuate the
place and join him in the field. Again, as on the
former occasion, Halleck refused to sanction this, in
spite of the obvious fact that the Confederates must
certainly and easily capture the whole of that force
unless it should save itself by timely retreat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
About this time Hooker, in disgust at the restraints
to which he was subjected, asked to be relieved
of the command of the Army of the Potomac,
and General Meade, a very much abler man, was
appointed to succeed him. Meade instantly ordered
the evacuation of Harper's Ferry&mdash;the very thing
that Hooker had been forbidden to order, and thus
saved eleven thousand seasoned troops to the Army
with which he must presently confront Lee.</p>

<p>On the twenty-eighth of June Lee's army lay at
Chambersburg, York, and Carlisle, in Pennsylvania.
In that position it threatened Baltimore, Harrisburg
and Philadelphia about equally. It might move upon
either at will and in either case cut off Washington.
The problem of the Army of the Potomac was to
find out its adversary's intention and interpose itself
at whatever point interposition might seem to be most
necessary.</p>

<p>In the course of this advance, Lee made one capital
blunder. It was his courteous custom, in giving
orders to his higher lieutenants, to leave much to their
discretion, if only by way of emphasizing his confidence
in them. In this case he left much to the discretion
of Stuart, who had no discretion, although he
had every other good quality of the soldier. Lee
ordered Stuart to make certain movements if they
commended themselves to his judgment, but left him
in effect free to do as he pleased, assuming that he
would please to do that which was discreet, bearing in
mind that the cavalry are the eyes and ears of the
army.</p>

<p>It was Stuart's chief business to find out and report<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
every movement of the Army of the Potomac,
to follow its every march, to learn what it was planning
to do, and at every step to find out and report to
Lee the force employed in each maneuver. Stuart
was an adept in this work. No man then living&mdash;probably
no man who ever lived&mdash;knew better than
he did how to find out the purposes of an enemy or
to estimate his strength or to determine where and
when that enemy meant to strike.</p>

<p>But by virtue of his orders, Stuart was free to do
what he pleased; and it pleased him to find out how
nearly his cavaliers could ride into Washington, to
throw shells into that city and generally to impress
himself dramatically and theatrically upon the Federal
administration as a terror.</p>

<p>As a consequence Lee was left without that information
as to his adversary's movements which he
depended upon the cavalry to furnish. While Stuart
was trying to throw shells into Washington, Meade
was concentrating his forces toward Gettysburg, to
meet his opponent there and Lee was left in ignorance
of the fact.</p>

<p>Accordingly when the head of Lee's somewhat
scattered and straggling column came upon a Federal
force occupying a strong position at Gettysburg
which it had been Lee's intention that his own advance
forces should seize and hold, there were all the
elements of surprise in the situation.</p>

<p>Neither army was as yet sufficiently concentrated
to deliver a blow that might be decisive. Lee had in
all about 73,500 infantry and artillery&mdash;the largest
army he ever commanded. Meade had about 82,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
effective infantry and artillery. The cavalry on
each side numbered ten or eleven thousand sabers,
but Lee's horsemen were absent, trying to make a
display of themselves, while Meade's were in front,
where they ought to have been, trying to secure for
their commander full information and promptly to
seize upon the best positions that might avail to give
him advantage in the approaching fight. This difference
gave to Meade about 93,000 fighting men
against 73,000 on the other side.</p>

<p>Lee's army was strangely scattered. A part of it
was at York; a part of it at Carlisle; a part of it at
Chambersburg, and another part in front of Gettysburg.
Because of Stuart's aberration Lee knew
nothing of his enemy's movements until the head of
his column ran against Meade's forces at Gettysburg.
He seems to have expected Meade to remain south of
the Potomac, or at the most to cross that river and
place himself in the northern defenses of Washington.
He had ordered the concentration of the Confederate
forces at Gettysburg without the smallest
expectation of finding the Army of the Potomac
there to meet him in full force.</p>

<p>A glance at a map will show the reader how completely
the position at Gettysburg dominates the
military geography, and how perfectly his mastery
of it would have enabled Lee to dictate the further
course of the campaign.</p>

<p>It is greatly to the credit of General Meade as a
strategist that he quickly saw all this and hurried his
army forward to occupy that commanding position
before Lee could seize upon and control it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
He did this masterfully. When Lee's advance
reached Gettysburg on the first of July, it found
itself opposed by a force too great for it to deal with
in any summary fashion. And that force had seized
upon positions of the utmost strategic value before
the Confederates reached Gettysburg.</p>

<p>Here a little topographical information is necessary
to a clear understanding. With the aid of any
good map of the region it may be condensed into brief
space.</p>

<p>The town of Gettysburg was itself of no consequence
to either side. The military position among
the hills surrounding it was vitally important.</p>

<p>Many roads converge at this point. A trifle over
two miles south of the town there are two bold and
commanding hills&mdash;Round Top and Little Round
Top. From these a line of hills extends toward the
town, commanding the lower ground to the east and
west. This is called Cemetery Ridge, and is not to
be confounded with Seminary Ridge, presently to be
mentioned. Cemetery Ridge, just before it reaches
the town, trends off to the east and ends in Culp's
Hill.</p>

<p>West of the town is another and higher ridge, also
running north and south, called Seminary Ridge.
Just west of these high grounds is Willoughby Run,
a little creek which afforded opportunity for attack
and defense.</p>

<p>When Lee learned that Meade, instead of sitting
down to the defense of Washington, was advancing
against his communications, he ordered his army to
concentrate at Gettysburg for a decisive battle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
Meade in the meanwhile was pushing his columns to
that point. Here were two masters of the game of
war, who, while opposing each other, were agreed
that Gettysburg was the key to the situation. The
strategic value of that point was equally apparent
to both.</p>

<p>Lee, being left in the dark by Stuart's absence,
was slowly advancing in detachments, in order to
subsist his army upon the country, confident that his
enemy was still lingering around Washington and
that he had himself ample time in which to seize
the commanding positions in advance of the foe's
approach. Meade, meanwhile, was perfectly informed
of Lee's movements and was hourly quickening
his march.</p>

<p>When the head of Lee's column under Ewell
reached the neighborhood of Gettysburg on the first
of July, it encountered not only the Federal cavalry,
which it had expected to find there and to brush aside
without difficulty, but the whole of Meade's advance
corps&mdash;artillery and infantry&mdash;under Reynolds, while
another corps under Howard was hurrying up in
support.</p>

<p>Seizing upon the line of Willoughby Run the Federals
undertook to hold it and the hills in rear of it
against the enemy's assault. Ewell, expecting to encounter
no resistance except such as the cavalry and
perhaps some brigades of Pennsylvania militia, could
offer, advanced confidently only to find his way disputed
by some of the best veteran corps of the Army
of the Potomac.</p>

<p>Reynolds, commanding the Federal advance, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
killed early in the action and Doubleday succeeded
him. Howard presently superseded Doubleday in
chief command and later Hancock replaced Howard.</p>

<p>So completely had Lee been left in the dark by the
vagaries of his cavalry leader that in ordering Ewell's
advance upon Gettysburg he had intended only that
his lieutenant should brush away the cavalry and
militia there, seize upon the strategic positions and
hold them easily until the Confederate army could
come up and plant itself impregnably to receive the
attack which the foe must make in sheer desperation.
But when Ewell approached the town and
found himself confronted by the strongest corps of
Meade's army instead of merely having cavalry and
militia to deal with, it was imperative upon him to
bring on a general action at once, in disobedience of
Lee's order to avoid such an action until the other
Confederate army corps should come up. Ewell was
much too wise a soldier not to see the necessity of
striking at once and with all the force he could command
in the hope of securing for Lee some at least
of the strong positions and thus giving to the Confederates
an opportunity to fight the great and inevitable
battle with a reasonable hope of winning it.</p>

<p>So Ewell struck hard with what force he had, and
the enemy struck back with equal vigor. Hour after
hour the conflict endured, the men on both sides fighting
with determination and calmly enduring a slaughter
that only veterans could have stood.</p>

<p>When Lee heard the roar of the conflict and, with
practised ear measured its severity, he hurried forward
reinforcements as fast as possible, and meanwhile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
sent a messenger to ask Ewell "What are you
fighting there?" In response Ewell answered, "The
whole Yankee army, I think."</p>

<p>Here at last the advance forces of the two greatest
and gallantest armies ever assembled on this continent
had met, each under a leader in whom it had
confidence. Here at last, with approximately equal
numbers those two armies faced each other with intent
to fight out to a finish the question which of them was
the better organized for the work of war. The Federals
outnumbered the Confederates by no more than
15,000 men or so, and the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élan</i> the Confederates had
brought with them out of recent victories, together
with their limitless confidence in Lee's superiority to
any living man as a general, served adequately to offset
that small advantage.</p>

<p>The courage of the men on both sides was matchless.
Their endurance was superb. Their heroism
was such as poets rejoice to celebrate in song. The
drama, with all its arts and all its accessories has no
"effects" to offer, that can for one instant compare
in masterfulness with those presented by the story of
this struggle of Americans against Americans for
the mastery.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the day, the Confederate onsets
proved irresistible and the Federal forces in large
part at least, fell into retreat. But with the cavalry
standing fast and with a brigade of infantry strongly
posted on Cemetery Ridge, Hancock, who had assumed
command on the field, succeeded in stopping
the flight and forming a new line along the crest of
Cemetery Ridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
Thus ended the first day's fight. The Confederates
had had the better of it in certain ways. They
had been taken by surprise, not in the usual way by
being unexpectedly set upon by an army whose
assault they were not anticipating, but by finding in
their path, when seeking to occupy an advantageous
position, a veteran army skilfully handled and well
commanded, where they had expected to meet only
light bodies of cavalry and militiamen whose resistance
they might regard as lightly as they would the
small embarrassment of a field of ripening grain.
They had lost heavily in the ensuing conflict, but they
had driven their foes&mdash;or most of them&mdash;into retreat
and had occupied positions from which the great
battles of the ensuing days might be waged with hope
and confidence.</p>

<p>During all the night that followed, as during all
that first day of fighting, the army corps and divisions
and brigades on both sides marched ceaselessly
in an endeavor to put themselves into their places on
the line in time for the final struggle. Some of them,
on either side, marched eighteen miles, some twenty-five,
and one at least on the Federal side tramped
wearily over thirty-three miles of distance without
sleep or rest, in its eagerness to bear its part in what
promised to be the crowning conflict of the war.</p>

<p>But each side having secured a strong position
neither desired to bring on the conflict until its forces
should be fully up, and so the two armies did not fall
a-fighting again until about four o'clock in the afternoon
of the second day&mdash;July 2, 1863. Then Longstreet
with his Confederates fell upon Sickles with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
a fury that only a seasoned corps could have withstood
for a moment. Sickles occupied a line of rather
low-lying hills that stretched diagonally across between
the Federal and Confederate positions. His
left wing having no natural obstacle to rest upon, was
bent back toward Little Round Top, thus presenting
an angle to the enemy.</p>

<p>Upon this angle Longstreet's veterans were hurled
with determination, while a part of his corps&mdash;Hood's
fierce fighting Texans, and that most desperate of
rowdy corps, Wheat's Louisiana Tigers&mdash;passing
around the flank of it, made a determined attempt to
seize Little Round Top, a position from which, had
they secured it, their guns could have swept a large
part of the Federal line with a destructive enfilade
fire. General Warren saw the danger in time and
moved a heavy force toward the coveted hill, including
a battery whose guns the men dragged by hand
up the steep and into position.</p>

<p>Hood's men pressed on in face of the fire opened
upon them, and with a desperate determination rarely
equaled even in this war, endeavored to conquer the
position in a hand to hand struggle. The men on
both sides saw the vital importance of the position
and fought for its possession like so many war-drunken
demons. They fought hand to hand, using
bayonets when too close together to load and fire.
They brained each other with the butts of their muskets.
They assailed each other with bowie knives.
They even resorted to the use of stones, hurling them
in each other's faces and breaking each other's skulls
with heavy boulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
In the end Hood's attack was baffled, and Warren
held the hill. But for his alertness in seeing the necessity
and his wonderful determination in seizing the
opportunity, the battle must have been lost then and
there; for, with his guns planted on Little Round
Top, Lee could quickly have compelled the whole
Federal line to retire and seek some other field of
fighting.</p>

<p>Probably in all the course of the war the margin
between victory and defeat was never at any point
narrower than it was in that desperate struggle for
possession of Little Round Top, about sunset on the
second day of July, 1863. Never anywhere, before
or since, was there fiercer fighting. Never anywhere
did soldiers give a better account of themselves. Officers,
from lieutenants to generals, fell in numbers by
the side of their enlisted men, and over the whole
slope the ground was strewn with the dead and the
dying. Some of them wore the blue, and some of
them the gray&mdash;about equal numbers in each uniform&mdash;but
all of them were Americans and the memory
of their heroism is the common heritage of all the
people of the great Republic.</p>

<p>During these two days of terrific fighting the Federals
had got distinctly the worst of it. The Confederates
had not won a victory, but they had at any rate
secured advantages that might well give their adversaries
pause.</p>

<p>General Meade called a council of war after the
firing ceased on the night of the second. He has himself
declared that he had no thought of retreating
after the fashion that had been established by usage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
in the Army of the Potomac. General Meade's
truthfulness is wholly above suspicion. But General
Doubleday has pretty conclusively shown that General
Meade's memory was at fault in this and that his
object in calling the council of war was to take the
opinions of his lieutenants as to whether he should
withdraw from the Gettysburg position&mdash;as the
Army of the Potomac had withdrawn from so many
others after being worsted in battle&mdash;or should stay
there and fight the matter out.</p>

<p>However that may be&mdash;and historically it does not
matter&mdash;it was decided to stay there, and the night
was spent by both armies in diligent preparation for
a renewal of the desperate and not unequal conflict
on the morrow. Every man and every gun that was
within reach was brought into position. Every inch
of advantageous ground that either side commanded
was occupied to the full. Every preparation that
either of those titanic forces could make for the morrow
was made. It was at last the fixed purpose of
each of these great armies to give battle to the other
in a final contest for supremacy, in full conviction
that the whole question at issue between the warring
sections was deliberately staked upon the outcome of
this one desperate struggle.</p>

<p>And indeed the stake was no whit less than that.
It was obvious that should Meade beat and crush Lee
on this decisive battlefield, the very existence of the
Southern Confederacy would be at an end; the road
to Richmond would be open to any single army corps
that might be sent to undertake the conquest of the
Confederate capital, while a dozen or a score of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
strong divisions could easily be sent on that task if
necessary. On the other hand if Lee could have
crushed Meade in this battle Washington would have
been his for the taking, while Baltimore, Harrisburg,
Philadelphia, and New York would have been helpless
to offer any resistance which need in the least
check or embarrass him. In either case the war must
have come to a hurried end.</p>

<p>Thus, when it was decided to renew the battle on
the field of Gettysburg on the third of July, 1863,
the stakes of the war game included all that there was
of a cause on either side.</p>

<p>Lee was in a position in which he must take supreme
risks. Therein only lay his hope. Meade was
in a very different case. He might fall back and still
reserve to himself the opportunity to fight again with
hope of success. It is in no way astonishing that
Meade hesitated, called a council of war, and asked
for the advice of his major generals as to whether he
should risk the whole Federal cause upon the issue of
a single and very uncertain battle with such an adversary
as Lee, or should withdraw and adopt a defensive
attitude.</p>

<p>On the other side Longstreet strongly advised Lee
against giving battle in this position. Longstreet
thought Lee had accomplished enough. He thought
also that by shifting the position it was easily possible
for Lee to put himself in better and his adversary in
much worse case, for fighting, before bringing on
the battle.</p>

<p>Whether Longstreet's counsels were wise or otherwise,
only skilled military critics are competent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
determine; and even their determination must always
be open to doubt, especially as Longstreet's support
of Lee's plan of battle seems to have lacked something
of efficiency&mdash;the lack of which may have been
determinative of results.</p>

<p>At any rate Lee decided to give battle, and he
made his dispositions accordingly. He had already
assailed both flanks of the Federal army and found
both too strongly posted to be successfully turned or
crushed. He decided, therefore, to hurl his entire
strength directly against the Federal line in the hope
of breaking it and thus driving his enemy into disorderly
retreat.</p>

<p>It was a desperate thing to do, but Lee knew the
fact, which has since been recorded by a historian on
the other side, that the soldiers under his command
were "the best infantry on earth" and he hesitated not
to exact of them the most desperate and terrific work.
He knew at least that these men would do and dare
anything and everything in an attempt to carry out
his will and achieve the ends he purposed.</p>

<p>He assembled a hundred guns on Seminary Ridge,
each so well manned as to be capable of firing from
four to six times a minute. In answer the Federals
on Cemetery Ridge assembled about a like number of
guns, equally well served.</p>

<p>The greatest artillery duel that had ever occurred
was waged on that morning. Nearly a thousand
shells a minute were launched upon their life-destroying
career. Guns were knocked from their carriages,
only to be replaced by other guns for which there had
been no firing room before. Cannoneers were swept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
away like flies, and their places were promptly taken
by other cannoneers who eagerly and clamorously
claimed the privileges of the conflict. Caissons were
exploded by bursting shells and other caissons moved
into their places with the precision of mathematics
itself.</p>

<p>The Army of Northern Virginia and the Army of
the Potomac had learned their business. The men
who composed them now were soldiers, drilled,
trained, battle-seasoned and thoroughly hardened to
their work by long and varied experience. Whatever
it was possible for courage and endurance to accomplish,
that they were ready to undertake. They
no more thought of reckoning the personal danger
than of calculating the wanderings of the stars in
their courses. They stood their ground, nothing
daunting them and nothing suggesting to their minds
a thought of running away. Is it any wonder that
when such men composed the opposing armies, the
fighting was such as to make men admire and angels
weep?</p>

<p>The one thing that made the greater battles of the
Confederate war terrible was this fact that the two
armies were equally American in their composition,
equally determined, equally heroic in daring and in
enduring.</p>

<p>While all this fury of artillery fire continued, the
infantry on either side lay flat on their bellies, taking
advantage of every smallest inequality of the ground,
and waiting for the serious work of war to begin.
For by this time every soldier in either of these armies
knew all there was to know about war's work, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
every one of them knew that this terrific artillery
bombardment&mdash;the greatest that had ever occurred
since cannon were invented&mdash;was merely preliminary
to that onset of the infantry which was presently to
determine which of these two great armies should
have the mastery and which should be destroyed.</p>

<p>After two hours or more of this work with the
guns, there came Pickett's charge&mdash;one of the very
gallantest endeavors in all the history of war&mdash;having
for its only rival in heroic determination the six successive
charges of Federal troops up Marye's Heights
at Fredericksburg.</p>

<p>Fourteen thousand of Lee's "best infantry on
earth" were set to make this onslaught. Their task
was about the most difficult and terrible one that had
been anywhere undertaken during the war. There
was a full mile of open country lying between the
line from which they moved and the line which they
were called upon to assault. Every inch of that mile
of open space was swept by the fire of a hundred guns
served as guns were rarely served before or since. It
was in face of this veritable "fire of hell" that these
fourteen thousand men were required to traverse a
mile of space and then assail an entrenched and
strongly posted enemy like unto themselves in courage,
determination and all soldierly qualities.</p>

<p>They went to this work with unfaltering courage,
and at the end of it all a new chapter had been added
to the history of heroism.</p>

<p>The moment Pickett's men began their mile long
charge, the Federal cannon&mdash;about a hundred guns&mdash;resumed
their fire while the Confederate artillery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
must of course cease firing lest their shells plow
through the ranks of their own infantry. In spite
of all, and in face of a hailstorm of shot and shell the
Confederates steadily advanced. Great rents were
made in their lines by the explosion of shells, but the
gaps thus made were instantly closed up, and not for
one moment did the assaulting force recoil, or halt or
slacken the eager rapidity of its advance. As it
drew near to the enemy's lines the Federal fire was
changed from shell and shrapnel to canister in double
and triple charges&mdash;each gun hurling from a quart to
a gallon of balls every few seconds into the faces of
the still advancing and still cheering Confederates.
Presently, when the Southerners drew still nearer to
the lines, a great body of Federal infantry that had
been lying down and sheltering itself, rose and poured
murderous volleys into the ranks of the assailants.</p>

<p>Those ranks were withering now, under the destructive
fire, but still they faltered not nor failed.
Still they went forward to execute Lee's will, which
meant to them quite all that the will of God means to
the devotee.</p>

<p>They trampled over the advance lines of the enemy.
They pushed forward to the breastworks. They even
crossed the fortifications and for a brief space held
the lines they had been sent to conquer.</p>

<p>But so depleted were their ranks by this time, and
so strangely unsupported were they by those other
divisions which they had expected Longstreet to send
in after them, and which he did not send in, that they
were at last forced back by sheer weight of numbers.</p>

<p>A small remnant of that splendid charging column<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
returned to Lee's lines under a withering fire. The
rest of it lay dead or dying on the hillside.</p>

<p>It has always been a fact highly creditable to
American armies that the killed and wounded among
their officers of high rank in every severe conflict
relatively outnumber the casualties among the enlisted
men. At Gettysburg, on both sides, this was
conspicuously the case. On the Federal side General
Reynolds was killed early on the first day of the fight.
Later General Weed was mortally wounded; General
Vincent and Colonel O'Rorke were killed. So were
General Zook and Colonel Cross, while General
Sickles lost a leg. In the third day's fighting Generals
Hancock, Doubleday, Gibbon, Warren, Butterfield,
Stannard, Brooke and Barnes were wounded;
General Farnsworth was killed. On the Confederate
side the number of killed and wounded among
officers of high rank was equally great. General
Barksdale fell, leading his men in terrific assault.
General Armistead was shot to death as he laid his
hand upon a Federal gun, and in Pickett's matchless
charge, very nearly every officer, high and low, was
either killed or wounded. Their men were not sent
into the conflict; they were led into it, and between
those two things there is a world of difference.</p>

<p>Longstreet has criticised Lee for ordering Pickett's
charge. On the other hand Longstreet has been
severely criticised for not having supported that
charge with all his might, pushing forward every
man he could command to take the places of Pickett's
killed and wounded and to crown their superb endeavor
with compulsory success. Again Lee has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
criticised for having given Ewell, in command of his
left wing, uncertain and discretionary orders, instead
of directing him, at the time of Pickett's charge, to
hurl his whole force upon the enemy in his front, regardless
of all other considerations. These matters
are open questions that belong to military criticism
rather than to history. They need not be discussed in
these pages. But it belongs to history to relate that
when the struggle was at an end, and the people of the
South manifested a disposition to hold Longstreet responsible
for its failure to accomplish the results intended,
Lee promptly and definitely took upon himself
all there might be of blame for the miscarriage
of his plans. In a letter to President Davis he wrote
protesting that the responsibility was all his own, and
asking that some younger and fitter man than himself
should be appointed to succeed him in command
of that splendidly devoted and unfaltering army
which he had so often led to victory but on this occasion
had led to something akin to defeat and disaster.</p>

<p>There could scarcely be a stronger contrast than
that between Lee's generous refusal to have any of
his lieutenants held responsible for the results of a
battle which he had authority to direct and Hooker's
endeavor to shift to the shoulders of his subordinates
the responsibility for his phenomenal failure at
Chancellorsville. Lee was a great man, Hooker fell
far short of that measure.</p>

<p>Gettysburg was, like Sharpsburg or Antietam,
technically a drawn battle. Neither side had won a
recognizable victory. Neither army had driven its
adversary from the field. Neither had destroyed or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
even seriously impaired the fighting capacity of the
other. Neither had triumphed over the other. But
the result at Gettysburg as at Antietam was that
Lee's invasion of the North was brought to naught.
In the one case as in the other the Confederate hope
of compelling terms of peace was defeated by successful
resistance. To that extent at least the battle
had resulted in victory for the Federal arms.</p>

<p>When the fourth of July dawned, neither army
cared to assail the other. All day they confronted
each other sullenly, as they had done at Sharpsburg.
Then Lee slowly and deliberately withdrew, as he had
done on the former occasion, his enemy not having
confidence or strength enough to interfere in any
active way with his retirement. Lee's ammunition
was so far exhausted that many of his divisions had
only one round of cartridges, while many of his batteries
had none at all. But so terrible had been his
onset, and so greatly did his foe dread a further conflict
with him, that after taking his own time in the
enemy's country in which to determine what he would
do, he moved to the Potomac practically unmolested,
rested there because of high water, still unmolested,
and finally returned to Virginia. Meade slowly and
quite inoffensively followed. The two armies resumed
their old positions on the Rappahannock and
the Rapidan and neither ventured to assail the other
during the remainder of that summer or autumn.</p>

<p>Here was another of those strange pauses in the
war which history finds it difficult to explain. The
first battle of Manassas was fought on the twenty-first
of July, 1861. There was no further battling of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
consequence during that summer or autumn. The
battle at Sharpsburg was fought at the middle of
September, 1862; there was no further fighting until
the middle of December following. The Gettysburg
battle was fought during the first three days of
July, 1863, and throughout the long summer and
autumn that followed there was no activity on either
side. Not until May of the following year did the
armies that confronted each other in Virginia meet
again in conflict.</p>

<p>The wherefore of this inactivity has never been
explained.</p>

<p>But meanwhile events of the utmost importance
were occurring at the South and West, which claim
attention in another chapter.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Campaign of Vicksburg</span></span></h2>

<p>After Shiloh, Grant was left, as he himself has told
us, in a state of grave uncertainty as to the limits of
his command, and even as to the question whether or
not he had any command. After Halleck was transferred
to Washington and placed in the position of
General in Chief, things at the West did not much
mend. We have seen how Grant at Corinth was
slowly stripped of his forces and compelled to stand
mainly upon the defensive in a field where offense,
instant and vigorous, was obviously called for.</p>

<p>After the fall of Memphis, New Orleans, and
Baton Rouge, the Confederates were left in possession
only of that part of the Mississippi river
which lies between Vicksburg and Port Hudson.
Their possession of that stretch of river was doubly
important to them. Defensively, it enabled them to
blockade the river and render it a no-thoroughfare to
Federal troops and supplies. Still more importantly,
it enabled them to maintain their communications
with the country lying to the west of the Mississippi
in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas. From that region
they drew a very important part of their food
supplies. These came to Vicksburg by water or over
the Shreveport railroad on the west of the river, and
were carried from Vicksburg eastward by other lines
of railroad. A still more important line of communication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
was that by way of the Red river, which empties
into the Mississippi from the westward between
Vicksburg and Port Hudson.</p>

<p>To hold these routes seemed almost an absolute
necessity to the Confederates. To cut them and open
the Mississippi river from Cairo to the Gulf was
equally a necessity to the Federals.</p>

<p>Here were the conditions that rendered a campaign
inevitable, and in a degree marked out its course and
character. The Confederates energetically fortified
Vicksburg and Port Hudson, and planted posts at
various other points on both sides of the Mississippi
and on the Arkansas and Red rivers. The Federals
had made several attempts&mdash;one of them made by
Farragut himself&mdash;to open the Mississippi, but had
completely failed, largely because the Confederate
fortifications at Vicksburg were perched so high upon
the bluff that Farragut's guns could not be sufficiently
elevated to reach them.</p>

<p>It was not until the twelfth of November, 1862,
that General Grant was set free to do those things
which it was necessary to do in this quarter of the
country. On that date he received a dispatch from
General Halleck, giving him command of all troops
in his department, and authorizing him to conduct
operations there on his own judgment. Thus armed
with liberty to act, Grant instantly consulted Sherman,
in whose sagacity and in whose superb fighting
qualities he had the utmost confidence. These
two energetic commanders quickly agreed upon a
plan of action which looked to nothing less than the
capture of Vicksburg and Port Hudson, the opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
of the great river throughout its length, and the severance
of the Confederacy in twain.</p>

<p>Their plan at first was that Grant, with about
30,000 men, should move against the Confederate
General Pemberton, who had about an equal force in
the Tallahatchie river country, and occupy him there
while Sherman, with 30,000 more, should descend the
Mississippi in transports, convoyed by the gunboats,
and effect a landing within striking distance of Vicksburg.
Should Pemberton fall back for the defense
of that stronghold, Grant was to press him with all
possible vigor, endeavoring to cut him off from Vicksburg,
and leave Sherman free to deal with that fortress
as he pleased.</p>

<p>The Tallahatchie country, through which Grant
marched to assail Pemberton, is a tangled wilderness,
lying actually lower than the surface of the Mississippi,
and itself laced by multitudinous rivers, creeks,
and streams, all of them difficult of passage, even at
times of lowest water, and impossible of passage
when a rain or a break in a Mississippi levée suddenly
raises them to flood height. The region is, in fact, a
vast morass. In parts of it the planters were often
left for six, eight or ten months without communication
with the outer world, except by way of the rivers
themselves, during the winter. It is not difficult, even
for the reader who has no technical knowledge of war,
to understand how slowly and painfully a march
through such a country must be made, when not only
the cannon but a wagon train, carrying every ounce
of supplies necessary for 30,000 men must be dragged
at every step through a quagmire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
But this was not Grant's chief difficulty. With his
headquarters at Holly Springs, and a purpose to
press forward in a southwesterly direction, he must
maintain a long and attenuated line of communication
with his base at Columbus, Kentucky. The Confederates
were alert and ceaselessly active in assailing
this line and rendering it hopelessly insecure. They
sent heavy cavalry detachments under Van Dorn and
Forrest to cut him off from his base, and Van Dorn,
emboldened by repeated successes at last on the twentieth
of December assailed Holly Springs itself,
where Grant had accumulated many million dollars'
worth of supplies in preparation for his campaign.
The Confederate cavalrymen captured the town and
its garrison, burned all the stores and destroyed the
railroad buildings. In the meanwhile Forrest raiding
farther north cut the railroad between Jackson,
Tennessee, and Columbus, Kentucky, thus completely
severing Grant's line, and leaving him in the enemy's
country without supplies or the means of procuring
them.</p>

<p>In order to save his army Grant immediately abandoned
his plan of campaign and moved northwestward
to Memphis. His purpose now was to join
Sherman there, unite the two wings of the army, and
in company with Sherman and the gunboats move
down the river and assail Vicksburg in overwhelming
force.</p>

<p>But when Grant reached Memphis Sherman had
already gone down the river in his transports, accompanied
by Porter's gunboats, to a point called
Milliken's Bend. There on Christmas day Sherman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
had landed on both sides of the river, sending the
main body of his troops up the Yazoo, which empties
from the northeast into the Mississippi near that
point. He did this in order to assail the Confederates
on the bluffs north of Vicksburg.</p>

<p>At this point a little topographical explanation
seems necessary. Vicksburg lies on a great easterly
bend of the river. It is perched upon high bluffs
which extend thence northward to the Yazoo, striking
it at a point called Haines's Bluff.</p>

<p>From Milliken's Bend above Vicksburg Sherman
had sent a brigade down the western side of the river
to cut the railroad leading from Shreveport, Louisiana,
to that city. Landing his main force under the
bluffs on the Yazoo, he hoped to march southward in
the rear of Vicksburg, and cut the railroad which
leads thence to Jackson, Mississippi, the state capital,
about fifty miles away. If he could accomplish this
he would have Vicksburg isolated from communication
on either side of the river.</p>

<p>In all this he was instantly and completely baffled.
Low grounds bordered the Yazoo at the point of
landing, while the Confederates occupied and had
cannon-crowned the bluffs at a little distance from the
stream. The flat lands with their marshes were pestilential
to the young men of the northwest who constituted
Sherman's army. At times of high water
the lowlands were often overflowed to a depth of ten
feet. They were at all times malarial, and such water
as could be had by digging a foot or two into the
mucky soil was simply poisonous for human beings
to drink. On the other hand, the Southerners on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
bluffs above were living in much more salubrious conditions.
They had the advantage also of being immune
by lifelong use to the miasms which laid so many
of the Northern soldiers low. It is scarcely too much
to say that the spores of miasmatic disease were at
this time more important to the Confederates as a
means of defense than their powder and bullets were.</p>

<p>Still further, Sherman had been misled and misinformed
with regard to the character of the bluffs
which he must assail. He had supposed them to be
easily accessible to such lithe young fellows as those
northwestern boys who constituted the pith and marrow
of his army. He found them instead scarcely
more accessible than the steeps of Gibraltar itself.
And as at Gibraltar, so at this point the men standing
upon the defense not only occupied the heights,
but held their bases with a bristling row of well-served
cannon, strongly supported by an infantry as good
as any that ever fought. The approaches across
bayous and creeks and broad marshes were narrow
and difficult. The Confederates had fully made good
their deficiency in numbers by so planting their cannon
and their riflemen as to command these approaches
completely.</p>

<p>It was on the twenty-ninth of December, 1862,
that Sherman made his desperate attack. One brigade,
by determined fighting, reached the foot of the
bluffs but was instantly hurled back again, leaving
five hundred of its men stark and stiff on the battlefield.
At another point a regiment of daring fellows
reached the base of the headland and found it impossible
either to go forward or to retreat without inviting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
destruction. The men dug rat holes for themselves
at the base of the bluffs, and did what they
could in the way of self-protection, while the Confederates
on the cliffs above kept up a murderous
vertical fire upon them throughout the day, until
nightfall mercifully came and brought with it an
opportunity for the Federals to retire.</p>

<p>In this struggle Sherman lost nearly two thousand
men, while the Confederate loss was less than two
hundred&mdash;one man killed on the one side to ten laid
low on the other.</p>

<p>Sherman was a man not easily daunted. He was
not yet ready to abandon his plan, to admit himself
defeated or even to suspend his preternatural activity.
He instantly decided upon still further assaults at
other points. He arranged that the transports should
carry the bulk of his army further up the river to
Haines's Bluff during the night with the purpose of
taking the Confederate works there by assault from
the rear. There came a great fog so that the transports
could not find their way, and so this plan miscarried.</p>

<p>By this time Sherman discovered that great bodies
of Confederates were being hurried into the defensive
works surrounding Vicksburg. He had previously
heard nothing whatever from Grant, and it was only
in this way that he learned that Grant had somehow
failed to hold Pemberton in check, and that he,
therefore, had in front of him the greater part of the
Confederate army instead of the little garrison which
he had set out to encounter and overcome.</p>

<p>Sherman was a man of wits and promptitude. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
wasted no time in speculation, but at once reëmbarked
his troops and returned to the mouth of the
Yazoo, thus abandoning as a failure the campaign
which he had undertaken in full confidence that it
would be crowned with distinguished success. He
did not abandon the hope of ultimately reducing the
Vicksburg stronghold, but for the time being he knew
not how to go on with that enterprise with any tolerable
prospect of success. He sat still, therefore, for
a day or two, until on the fourth of January, 1863,
General McClernand was placed in command of the
forces which Sherman had previously controlled.</p>

<p>Many little actions followed, most of them directed
to the purpose of breaking up small tributary Confederate
posts and fortresses on the Arkansas river
and elsewhere in the neighborhood. In these little
operations the Federals were in the main successful,
but as yet they had achieved nothing that seriously
threatened the integrity of the Confederate position
at Vicksburg, and that alone was the real object of
their persistent endeavors.</p>

<p>Then came Grant. His coming opened a new
chapter in the war for the possession of the Mississippi
river. He brought to bear upon the problem all
that superb determination, that dauntless courage
and that splendid obstinacy which afterward won for
him his place in history.</p>

<p>He had no particular plan at first, because he was
not yet familiar with the terms and conditions of the
problem he was set to solve. But he intended to take
Vicksburg, and he did not intend to fritter away the
energies of his army in little side expeditions which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
in no important way could affect the general result.
He called in all the troops who had been sent by
McClernand to unimportant points and set himself at
work to find a way of conquering the stronghold, the
conquest of which was the sole object of his campaign.</p>

<p>The difficulties that presented themselves were
many and exceedingly great. While Vicksburg,
itself, was perched upon high hills, every conceivable
road to it lay through swamps and morasses naturally
defended by streams that were bottomed with
unfathomable mud.</p>

<p>The best approaches to the town were from points
farther down the river, but except by desperate endeavor
it was impossible to reach those approaches
so long as the works at Vicksburg completely commanded
the stream. Grant was satisfied that if he
could reach any point on the river below Vicksburg
where a landing was practicable he could march thence
into the rear of the town and compel its surrender.</p>

<p>In order to accomplish this he sent McClernand and
Sherman to cut a canal across the peninsula made by
the great bend in the river west of Vicksburg. This
effort proved a failure, partly through engineering
difficulties and partly because there were bluffs on
the eastern side of the river below Vicksburg, which
the Confederates promptly fortified and armed in
such fashion as to command the outlet of the proposed
canal.</p>

<p>Grant soon saw that even if he should succeed in
making this canal cut-off, he must still find himself
confronted on the river bank by heavily armed and
high-placed works as difficult for his flotillas to pass
as were the bluffs at Vicksburg itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
He continued the work, however, in despair of anything
better to do until early in March when a sudden
flood in the Mississippi completely overflowed
the peninsula on which the Federals were working,
and compelled Sherman to withdraw hastily to save
his army from drowning.</p>

<p>Grant's next scheme was by cutting another canal
to carry his flotilla through Lake Providence west of
the Mississippi, and thence by way of the many navigable
bayous in that quarter to a point on the river
well below Vicksburg. A good deal of digging was
done in an attempt to carry out this plan, but in the
end it failed as completely as the former one had
done.</p>

<p>Grant now turned his attention to possibilities on
the eastern side of the Mississippi. By blowing up a
levée he tried to open again an old and abandoned
waterway from the Mississippi into the Yazoo river,
by way of the Tallahatchie and Yalobusha rivers.
Those two streams unite at Greenwood to form the
Yazoo river. They are narrow, tortuous, uncertain of
channel, and densely wooded along their banks. The
Confederates with their ceaseless and alert activity
swarmed on the banks of these rivers, and obstructed
them not only by the fire of sharpshooters, and now
and then of a field battery, trained against the advancing
flotilla, but still more effectively by felling
trees into the stream and thus rendering it impassable.
Presently Grant found also that the Confederates
were engaged in a system of defense still more
dangerous to him than this. While obstructing his
pathway down these streams in the way described they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
were also felling trees into the channels in the rear
of his flotilla, and constructing strong earthworks
along the banks above him. It was obvious that he
must withdraw at once from his perilous position or
encounter something worse than a mere risk of
capture.</p>

<p>The work of extricating himself was difficult, but
with strong reinforcements continually coming to
him Grant succeeded in accomplishing it.</p>

<p>Still he did not abandon his hope of getting into
the rear of Vicksburg by some movement from the
north. The Yazoo river was connected by many
bayous and other watercourses on the west of Haines
Bluff with its tributary, the Big Sunflower. Grant
decided to go up the Yazoo to Steele's Bayou and to
go on up that watercourse, through some difficult
passes into the Big Sunflower; thence he planned to
descend the last-named stream, and strike the Yazoo
again above the fortifications at Haines Bluff. If he
could accomplish this he would have an open and comparatively
easy road into the rear of Vicksburg.</p>

<p>This effort was met and baffled, as the former one
had been, by Confederate obstructions in the streams,
and by ceaseless annoyance from the woodlands on
the banks. So active were the Confederates that at
one time Commodore Porter seriously contemplated
the abandonment of all his gunboats and transports.
His energy, however, and his wonderful skill in navigation
saved him at last from this humiliating necessity.
By backing through streams in which there
was not room enough to turn around, he managed at
last to retreat lobster fashion, through thirty miles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
tangled and crooked waterways, under a constant and
galling fire from the banks, and in the end to get back
into openly navigable waters.</p>

<p>As a wise and discreet commander, it was Grant's
habit to adopt those measures which promised success
at the smallest cost of human life&mdash;these first. But
as a man of indomitable courage and determination,
it was his habit also, if the less costly method failed,
to venture upon more desperate courses with a single-minded
determination to accomplish his purposes at
whatever hazard and whatever sacrifice. He was
convinced now, that in order to conquer the stronghold
at Vicksburg he must manage in some way to
place his army on the river bank below that city in
some position from which he could march into its
rear. To do this involved a world of difficulty, incredible
hardship, and immeasurable danger. He
must somehow get his army past the town, and into
a position where it would be hopelessly dependent
upon such stores as he could carry with him for the
maintenance of his troops from day to day.</p>

<p>In order to reach such a position he must take incredible
risks, and, having attained it, he must find
himself isolated without communications of any sort,
and dependent upon complete and quick success for
the very existence of his army. Having once placed
himself in that position he must promptly conquer
Vicksburg, or ingloriously surrender all his force.</p>

<p>Fortunately, he had for his coadjutor one of the
most enterprising and most daring men who ever
commanded a ship. David D. Porter, in his personal
character, was typical of that all-unfaltering courage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
which the officers of the American navy have always
exacted of each other and of themselves as the
measure of a man. Porter was ready for anything.
Cool-headed, skilled in navigation, resolute, and
thoroughly familiar with the problems of the Mississippi,
he responded instantly and eagerly to Grant's
demand that he should run his fleet past the Vicksburg
batteries at any and every hazard and place it
in a position below, where the gunboats might serve
as transports to the troops if Grant could manage
to get the troops there.</p>

<p>This thing was splendidly done, and perhaps nothing
more picturesque or dramatic occurred during the
war. Porter chose the night, of course, for his attempt,
but the Confederates on the shore had long
anticipated some such enterprise and had prepared
themselves to overcome the difference between night
and day. They had collected great piles of lumber
on the banks; they had filled many houses with combustibles,
and to all these they instantly set fire when
it was known that the fleet was endeavoring to pass
the batteries. The river and the entire landscape
were rendered lurid by the flames. The men behind
the guns on shore were enabled to deliver their fire as
accurately as if the sun had been shining. The fleet,
in the meanwhile, replied to every shot as it steadily
steamed by, and in spite of the hellish appearances
the losses on either side were trifling.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Grant had moved on the western
side of the Mississippi, from Milliken's Bend to a
point opposite Grand Gulf. There he found the
Confederates strongly fortified, but by moving down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
the river to Bruinsburg he succeeded in getting his
army across on the thirtieth of April.</p>

<p>If the reader will now look at a map, remembering
that Vicksburg and Port Hudson were both held
by the Confederates, and that the regions along the
river bank on the western side of the stream were
quagmires, traversed at every step by impassable
streams and bayous, he will have some conception of
the boldness of this movement of Grant's. The great
fighter had deliberately carried his army into a position
where he had no possibility of communication
with any base of supplies in either direction. He had
cut himself off from all help and must henceforth
rely exclusively upon himself. He had put himself
in a position where victory was the only alternative
to destruction. During all the course of the war no
other general on either side ventured upon so desperate
a risk as this.</p>

<p>Having marched over difficult roads, and by circuitous
routes, Grant had brought with him, of course,
supplies of food and ammunition sufficient only for
a very brief campaign. For further food than this
he must depend upon a country by no means rich in
supplies at any time, which had already been stripped
nearly bare by the requisitions of his adversary. For
ammunition, beyond the store that he had in his
caissons and cartridge boxes, he had no supply-source
at all. To employ the old metaphor of war history,
he had completely burned his ships and his bridges
behind him. But at least and at last he had succeeded
in placing himself in a position from which he could
operate in the rear of Vicksburg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
The Confederate general, Joseph E. Johnston&mdash;just
recovered from the well-nigh mortal wound he
had received at Seven Pines&mdash;had been sent to Jackson,
Mississippi, less than fifty miles east of Vicksburg
to take command of such forces as could be
gathered there. He had in fact collected a considerable
body of men whose numbers Grant could in no
wise ascertain. Nevertheless, Grant determined to
push his own army into a perilous position between
that of Johnston at Jackson, and that of Pemberton
near Vicksburg. He was aided in this by a great
cavalry raid which had recently been made by Grierson
from the north which swept through the Mississippi
country, desolating it and occupying the attention
of the Confederates in many quarters from
which, but for this diversion, Johnston might easily
have drawn reinforcements.</p>

<p>During the next two months the battling was well-nigh
incessant, and the losses on both sides, though incurred
in comparatively small engagements, amounted
in the aggregate to those of a great contest. One
considerable battle occurred on the fifteenth of May
at Champion Hills. Having captured the city of
Jackson and destroyed there everything that could
aid the Confederates in their struggle, Grant had
turned westward in a direct march toward Vicksburg.
At Champion Hills he encountered Pemberton, who
had taken up a strong position on high ground and
who desperately resisted the Federal advance. After
four hours of such fighting as only veterans could
have done or stood, Pemberton retreated, leaving his
dead, his wounded and thirty guns on the field. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
losses on either side were between twenty-five hundred
and three thousand men. Yet this battle of Champion
Hills is scarcely known by name to the millions
of youths who every year pass their examinations in
American history. A smaller but still considerable
battle was fought on the Big Black river on the seventeenth,
resulting in a loss of eighteen guns and two
thousand men to the Confederates.</p>

<p>From that point Pemberton retired to Vicksburg
and Grant following, closely besieged that city. In
the meanwhile his operations had been so far successful
that he was now in command of a point on the
Yazoo where he established a secure base of supplies.</p>

<p>In apprehension of an attack from Johnston in
the rear, Grant made a tremendous effort on the
twenty-second to carry the Vicksburg works by
storm, but was beaten off with losses so heavy that he
determined to settle down into regular siege operations.</p>

<p>During the period of this siege the situation in
Vicksburg was appalling in an extreme degree. The
Federal guns were near enough to pour a continuous
stream of shells into the town, and they did so without
pause, night or day. The inhabitants, including
women and children, were ceaselessly under a fire
that might well have staggered the courage even of
veteran soldiers. No house in the town was for one
moment a safe dwelling place, and for refuge the
people dug caves in the cliffs and harbored there unwholesomely.
In the meanwhile they were suffering
under progressive starvation. The food supplies
were daily dwindling, yet with splendid courage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
those who were beleaguered in the city maintained
their cheerfulness to the end, as is testified by files of
that daily journal printed upon the back of wall
paper which appeared at its appointed time every day
and in spite of all, until the end.</p>

<p>The end came on the fourth of July, one day
after the failure of Lee's final assault at Gettysburg.</p>

<p>Pemberton surrendered unconditionally, and Grant
generously directed that the surrendered men should
first be fed and then paroled and permitted to return
to their homes.</p>

<p>One event which belongs rather to biography than
to history may perhaps be mentioned here in illustration
of General Grant's delicacy of sentiment,&mdash;a
trait in his character often overlooked. When it was
arranged that the surrendered Confederates should
march out, General Grant issued an order to forbid
all demonstrations that might wound a conquered
enemy's pride or sensitiveness. "Instruct the commands,"
the order read, "to be orderly and quiet as
these prisoners pass, and to make no offensive remark."</p>

<p>Thus at Vicksburg, as at Appomattox many
months later, that soldier who has been accounted the
least sensitive of all to considerations of sentiment,
manifested a generous delicacy to which all honest
minds must make reverent obeisance. During his
correspondence with Pemberton concerning the surrender,
Grant had declined to consider any terms that
limited or imposed conditions upon the capitulation.
But he had also generously written to his adversary
as follows: "Men who have shown so much endurance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
and courage as those now in Vicksburg will always
challenge the respect of an adversary, and I can
assure you that you will be treated with all the respect
due to prisoners of war."</p>

<p>Grant's supplies, in his difficult position, were
meager in the extreme, and it is one of the most
touching incidents of the war that his men voluntarily
furnished from their own haversacks the food
their famished enemies needed, thus cutting off their
own dinners in order that these starving foes might
not longer suffer the pangs of hunger. Such incidents
go far to redeem war from its curse of brutal
barbarity.</p>

<p>Five days after the fall of Vicksburg, Port Hudson
was surrendered, and in Mr. Lincoln's own phrase,
thenceforth the Mississippi "flowed unvexed from
its source to the sea." The Confederacy was cut in
twain. The end seemed to be foreordained beyond
peradventure, but the determined courage and endurance
of the Confederates was destined to postpone
that end for nearly two years longer.</p>

<p>The result of this campaign taken in connection
with the baffling of Lee's invasion of the North at
exactly the same time, in effect determined the issue
of the war. From that hour forward, as we now see,
it was certain that the Federal cause must ultimately
triumph; but how and at what cost remained in the
womb of fate.</p>

<p>Grant's conquest of Vicksburg and of the Mississippi
river was a result inestimably valuable to the
Federal cause if viewed only in its strategic, geographical
and other external aspects. But it bore one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
other fruit of immeasurably greater importance even
than these things. It discovered to the government
at Washington the existence and the capacity of a
commander capable of measuring swords with Robert
E. Lee. It taught the authorities at Washington at
last the lesson which ought to have been learned by
them many moons earlier, namely that in Grant the
nation had at its service a man great enough to understand
the war problem and to solve it&mdash;a man
capable of clearly seeing and perfectly understanding
that the Confederate strength lay in the fighting
force of the Southern armies, rather than in the possession
of strategic positions&mdash;a man fit to use the
enormously superior resources of the North in men,
money and material, in such fashion as to break the
resisting power of the Army of Northern Virginia.</p>

<p>Grant was eminently a man of common sense
rather than of imagination. The picturesque and the
romantic appealed to him scarcely at all. War was
to him a problem in physics. It was his habit of mind
when any undertaking was set for him to do, carefully
to weigh the means at his command and the
means at the command of his enemy, and judiciously
to employ whatever superiority of means he possessed
for the accomplishment of the purposed end. There
had been much strategy of another sort than this employed
in the conduct of the war on the Federal side.
There had been much of sentiment brought to bear
ineffectually, and often with disastrous results. With
the coming of Grant the turn of common sense had
come, and Grant preëminently represented common
sense, backed by daring, determination and tireless
energy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
After Vicksburg the days of the dominance of
Halleck and his kind were numbered. The time was
approaching when capacity was to take command in
lieu of regularity; when sense was to replace shoulder
straps; when the man under the uniform was to count
for more than the uniform. The Galena clerk,
Ulysses S. Grant, was a few months hence to succeed
to the command of all the armies of the United
States, replacing the pet of an antiquated system.</p>

<p>Two thirds of a year were yet to elapse before this
change in the administration of Federal military affairs
should completely take place, but its coming
was sure and with it the beginning of an end to a
struggle which had already cost the country much of
its best blood and untold millions of its treasure.</p>

<p>To the nation the best result of the Vicksburg campaign
was its discovery of Grant.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The State of Things After Gettysburg</span></span></h2>

<p>The summer of 1863 presented the most interesting
epoch of the war. The baffling of Lee's second
attempt to invade the North left the struggle in Virginia
about as it had been before, except that Lee's
veteran army continued to grow steadily stronger in
morale and weaker in numbers. The operations at
the West, however, had been very disastrous to the
Confederates. Their chief city had been taken and
was firmly held. Their armies had been driven out of
Missouri, Kentucky and the greater part of Tennessee.
The Mississippi river had been completely
wrested from their possession and the Confederacy
had been cut in two.</p>

<p>Some critics, writing at a later time, have held that
these conditions demanded the abandonment of the
Confederate cause, and called for a suit for peace on
the part of the Southerners, upon whatever terms the
Federal Government might be willing to grant.
Those who take this view do so, it would seem, upon
inadequate conceptions of the conditions and the
facts. Had the South been a European country,
with all its problems of military geography wrought
out, with its strategic positions marked upon myriads
of maps, with all lines of communication definitely
settled and fixed, the situation at midsummer in 1863<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
might well have justified an opinion of this kind. But
none of these conditions existed. The South was still
possessed of a vast area unplatted for military purposes,
abounding in obstacles that might be made effective
against any adversary's advance. Still more
important, there remained the spirit of the army and
an unconquerable determination on the part of the
people to exhaust every conceivable resource before
surrendering a cause which they believed to be absolutely
and eternally right.</p>

<p>They had been fed in childhood and youth upon the
memories and traditions of American history; they
had learned well the lesson that the battle is not always
to the strong; they did not forget those dark
hours of the American Revolution when Washington,
with a small, ragged and mutinous army, lay at Valley
Forge while the British occupied New York and
Philadelphia and were threatening to overrun Virginia,
Georgia and the Carolinas. It was their fixed
belief that their own cause in this Confederate war
was identical with that of their Revolutionary forefathers,
and they would have held themselves in contempt
had they shown a readier spirit of surrender
than that of the earlier Americans. They remembered
how even after the British had conquered
Charleston and Savannah, and with superior forces
had overrun Georgia and the Carolinas, some mere
handfuls of determined men under Marion, Sumter,
Pickens, Horry and their kind, had kept war alive
in those regions until such time as Greene should
come and by masterful strategy make his own defeats
more effective than victories, and ultimately reconquer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
their country from its conquerors, thus making
American independence possible. The Confederate
people, in their manhood, believed in and acted upon
that American history which they had learned in their
youth. Reverses only stimulated them to new endeavors,
and a more heroic endurance.</p>

<p>Finally, there remained the Army of Northern
Virginia, under command of Robert E. Lee. For
them to have abandoned their cause while such an
army under such a commander was still in the field
would have been a confession of weakness and cowardice
wholly beyond conception by such men. The
war was not yet over. The men who were fighting
it on the side of the South were still so potent in arms
that in that very month of July, 1863, the Government
of the United States found it necessary to resort
to an enforced draft in order to raise the 300,000
men called for three months before, to reinforce
armies that already outnumbered those of the South
by two to one and more.</p>

<p>So far was the Confederacy at that time from defeat
and the necessity of surrender that for a space it
was exceedingly uncertain whether or not the North
would furnish the quotas now called for. So small
was the confidence of the North in the administration,
and in the success of its methods, that in some parts
of the country volunteering had practically come to
an end.</p>

<p>As has been pointed out in a former chapter, there
was a party at the North, only slightly inferior in
strength to that of the administration, which determinedly
opposed the further prosecution of the war.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
This opposition was in part political and in part
economic. On its economic side it enlisted all those
men who had business interests or business hopes connected
with the Southern trade. On its political side
it included all men at the North who were opposed to
the policies and the principles of the Republican
party. It included also a vast multitude of men who
had from their youth up hated Abolitionism, and detested
the thought of negro equality in this land.</p>

<p>Still another force, and not a small one, had its
influence. There were men of earnest minds, throughout
the North, who seriously apprehended the undermining
of the Constitution and the destruction of
liberty in our country by the exercise of what are
called war powers. These men were genuinely and
patriotically alarmed when they saw the power of the
National Government used to suspend the habeas
corpus&mdash;that traditional bulwark of personal liberty
the existence of which has been for many centuries
regarded by all English-speaking men as their most
priceless possession. When these men saw in addition
a declaration of martial law, and the establishment of
a system of passports as rigid as that of any military
despotism, and when at last they saw the administration
openly assuming and exercising the power of
overturning the institutions of states by mere executive
proclamation, they grew gravely alarmed for
liberty itself. To them it seemed&mdash;rightly or wrongly&mdash;that
in the struggle to free the negro slaves of
the South there was very serious danger of incurring
the loss of liberty to all men in this Republic. Being
unwilling to exchange all that is fundamental in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
Republic for the freeing of some negro slaves these
earnest thinkers,&mdash;whether mistakenly or not,&mdash;opposed
with all their might the further progress of the
war and sought in every legal and constitutional way
to make an end of it.</p>

<p>This then was the situation. The North had armies
in the field vastly outnumbering those of its adversary
and immeasurably better equipped and supplied.
But public sentiment at the South was a unit, while
the North in its political views was a house divided
against itself. For the South to have abandoned its
cause at such a time and under such circumstances
merely by reason of military reverses, when it still
had in the field some hundreds of thousands of veteran
troops, would have been an act of cowardice inconceivable
to American men.</p>

<p>In New York City there was a complete failure to
make adequate response to Mr. Lincoln's demand for
further troops. Either the government must go
without the important quota from the principal city
in the nation, or else a draft must be ordered to make
good the deficiencies in the volunteering. This Republic
of ours had always thitherto depended upon
the patriotism of its people for such strength as it
might need in a fighting way. It had several times
happened that during wars against foreign powers
some parts of the country had manifested an unpatriotic
lack of enthusiasm, and had failed to furnish
their quotas of volunteers for the common defense.
But there had been then no thought of dragging men
unwillingly into the military service, although there
had been great public indignation throughout the rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
of the country over the unpatriotic attitude of a part
of the Union. The quotas that some of the states refused
to furnish were made good by a larger volunteering
in other parts of the country.</p>

<p>But in 1863 the conditions were radically different.
The war for which the new levies were wanted was a
war against Americans, and not for the defense of
the nation against foreign powers. In the view of
very many men it was, rightly or wrongly, regarded
as a war instigated by a sectional, political party in
the name of the nation for the destruction of all that
was fundamental in the nation. The time has long
gone by when it was worth while to argue the soundness
or unsoundness of these opinions. It is necessary
now only to record the fact of their existence in
aid of an understanding of what happened.</p>

<p>The draft was begun in New York on the eleventh
of July, 1863. That date fell upon a Saturday. The
draft had been opposed in some of the newspapers
and in public speeches as unconstitutional, and as an
invasion of those private rights which free government
is instituted among men to secure. There was
murmuring and muttering throughout the Saturday's
operations and by the time that Monday came there
was throughout the city an aroused spirit of protest
which threatened violence. That violence came with
a vengeance when the draft was resumed on Monday.
Angry crowds surrounded the offices in which the
drawings were to be made. The street cars were
stopped and their horses unhitched. Then the draft
offices were invaded and sacked, and in some cases
the buildings were set on fire. At one point an entire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
block was burned by the mob; at another point there
were battles fought between the populace and the
police which rivaled in violence and in slaughter
skirmishes on the lines in Virginia. Mobs filled the
streets in every direction, and for a time had their
own way. The office of the New York "Tribune" was
assailed and it was defended only by running out
chutes from which hand grenades could be dropped
into the throngs below, and by arming the printers
and other employees with muskets and abundant
cartridges. The office of the "Evening Post" was
defended against the mob by steam jets shot from
hose attached to the boilers that worked the machinery
and the presses.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile every negro who made his appearance
in the street was assaulted and eleven of
them fell victims to the anger of the populace. A
negro orphan asylum in Fifth avenue at 44th street
was sacked and burned by the infuriated rioters and
its helpless little wards narrowly escaped by the way
of back doors.</p>

<p>In Second avenue the police and soldiers were attacked
from the windows and the roofs of houses.
They quickly wreaked a terrible vengeance. They
pushed their way into every house and every room of
every house, assailed everybody they could find there,
whether guilty or innocent of offense, thrust many
of them through with bayonets without inquiring as
to their degree of culpability, brained many others
in like unquestioned manner with locust clubs, threw
some of them over balusters upon the stones below,
hurled some out of fourth and fifth story windows to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
be crushed upon the pavement, followed the fleeing
ones to the roofs, and shot them there as the most
northern of northern historians has recorded&mdash;we
quote his exact language&mdash;"refusing all mercy, and
threw the quivering corpses into the street as a warning
to the mob."</p>

<p>All this occurred more than forty-five years ago.
The war which gave birth to such fury is a matter of
history now, not of controversy. It is not worth while
nearly half a century later to inquire too curiously
into the rights and wrongs, or into the responsibilities
involved in such things. But it is perhaps of
human advantage, or at the least of curious historic
interest, to note that all these things were done in
professed service to that personal liberty which free
government among men is instituted to secure.</p>

<p>From the point of view of the angels and other superior
intelligences there could be nothing more gruesomely
ludicrous than the attitude and condition of
the American people on both sides of the war-drawn
lines at that period. On both sides men professed
and honestly believed that their supreme concern was
for the maintenance&mdash;in Mr. Lincoln's phrase&mdash;of a
"government of the people, by the people and for the
people." Yet on each side there existed, and men
consented to it, a military despotism as arbitrary, as
unreasoning, and as tyrannical as that of Russia
itself. On either side no man could travel without
permission of some provost authority which there
was nowhere any power to question or any court to
curb. On either side that military power which our
Constitution requires to be always subordinate to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
civil arm, had laid its iron hand without even the disguise
of a velvet glove upon the fate and fortune and
life of every citizen of a land supposed to be the
freest on earth. In New York men could be butchered
in their homes and thrown out of high windows
without so much as the order of a sheriff in justification.
In Richmond Winder's men made practical
prisoners of all soldiers and citizens who undertook
to traverse the streets upon however laudable an
occasion.</p>

<p>It is always thus in war. No sooner is the military
power invoked in aid of civil authority than it demands
and enforces the abdication of all civil authority
in so far as that authority may interfere in the
slightest degree with its arbitrary execution of its
own irresponsible will. So during this Confederate
war of ours we see a great people, free by inheritance,
free by tradition, and clamorously free by every conceivable
act of self assertion throughout generations
of history, suddenly and willingly surrendering to
military despotism all that they had ever dreamed of,
or clamored for, or fought for of personal right and
immunity, and doing all this in the name and in behalf
of liberty.</p>

<p>The despotism thus established at the South was
more perfect and more arbitrary than that which fell
upon the North because at the South there was practically
no party in existence that antagonized the
powers that were, while at the North there was such a
party that must in some ways be reckoned with.
Moreover, at the North the citizen who felt that he
could not endure the despotism had at any rate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
option to flee from it, and take up his residence in
some foreign country in which he might enjoy an
actually greater personal liberty; while the Southerner
who felt himself equally oppressed and wronged
was completely shut in and compelled to submit.</p>

<p>In the contemplation of history these facts and
conditions are curious and curiously interesting.</p>

<p>These were the conditions of the war at midsummer,
1863, after Lee's retirement from Gettysburg,
and after the loss of Vicksburg, Port Hudson and
the Mississippi river by the Confederates. They
were certainly not conditions suggesting an abandonment
of the struggle by either of the contestants, or
at all clearly foreshadowing its end in victory for
either. Anything in the way of results still remained
possible. To hopeful minds on either side everything
of good seemed likely to happen.</p>
</div>

<p>So the war went on.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_XLI" id="CHAPTER_XLI">CHAPTER XLI</a><br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Struggle for Charleston</span></span></h2>

<p>The Confederate war necessarily involved military
operations at very widely separated points at one and
the same time. The telling of its story, therefore, of
necessity involves a good deal of harking back, as the
huntsmen say.</p>

<p>While Lee's tremendous campaigns in Virginia,
Maryland and Pennsylvania had been going on, and
while Grant was engaged in conquering Vicksburg
and reopening the Mississippi river, there was important
fighting done at other points and particularly
at Charleston in South Carolina.</p>

<p>The earliest efforts of the Federal Government
to shut the Confederates in had been directed toward
the closing of the port of Charleston. There first a
blockading fleet had been established, and when it
proved ineffective an effort had been made very early
in the war to close the port by sinking hulks, loaded
with stone in the main channels, leading into that
harbor. Fortunately for all concerned, this effort
permanently to close a commercial port failed completely
and conspicuously. So far from obstructing
the entrance to the harbor, the sinking of the hulks
there had the effect of extensive dredging. The tide
flows in and out of the port with a tremendous current
which brooks no resistance. When the stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
laden hulks were sunk this current quickly swept
away the sand and mud from beneath them, so that
presently the harbor entrance was found to have been
actually deepened by the effort to close it.</p>

<p>From that time forward two objects engaged
Federal attention so far as Charleston was concerned;
one of these was to maintain in front of the
harbor a blockading squadron strong enough to prevent
the entrance and exit of ships. The other was
to force the harbor itself, capture its defenses and
recover the city to Federal possession. In both of
these efforts the Federal operations failed, but in
their progress they involved some of the severest and
most picturesque battling of the war.</p>

<p>The profits of blockade running were so great that
English capitalists invested lavish sums in the business
as a promising speculation. They built ships of
light draft, great power, and a speed greater than
that of any vessel in the American navy for the express
purpose of carrying on this forbidden traffic.
These ships had but little free-board exposed above
the water. They were painted a dull sage green, as
nearly as possible the color of the sea itself, when
looked at from a distance. They were commanded
by daring navigators and manned by equally daring
crews who stood ready to take any and every risk that
might aid in the achievement of ends so profitable as
those aimed at in this commerce.</p>

<p>And those profits were tempting in an extraordinary
degree. With cotton purchasable in the South
for a few cents per pound, payable in the enormously
depreciated Confederate currency, and salable in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
England at almost incredibly high prices in gold, and
with all forms of English-made goods bearing fabulous
prices in the South, it was easily calculable that if
a ship could complete one round trip from Nassau to
Charleston and back again and then should be lost
with all its cargo on a second attempt, there would
still remain to the owners a profit of not less than a
hundred per cent upon the money invested.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the steamer Minho, and several
others of the blockade runners continued until late in
the war to make their trips successfully, almost with
the regularity of packet boats. They carried into
Charleston stores of quinine, opium and other drugs
which the Confederate Government stood ready to
buy at fabulous prices. They carried clothing also,
and shoes and harness, all of which were eagerly purchased
at any price that the importers might choose
to charge. They carried out of Charleston the cotton
to which the markets of the world were otherwise
closed, and which could be purchased, therefore, at a
price so low as to make its cost an inconsiderable fraction
unworthy of consideration. So the blockade
running went on.</p>

<p>So far as the reduction of the city and its defenses
was concerned the failure of Federal efforts was still
more pronounced. Great sums were expended, vast
quantities of ammunition were wasted, and many lives
were sacrificed in an effort&mdash;futile from beginning
to end&mdash;to reduce this stronghold. Charleston, the
birthplace of Secession and of the Confederate war
remained in Confederate possession until the very
end. The city did not fall under Federal control until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
those closing days of the war when Sherman, after
his march to the sea, began his final movement northward
in rear of the Carolina port.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the struggle at that point was
marked by many fierce land contests in the country
round about, and by much heroic naval fighting.</p>

<p>The Confederates made such endeavors as they
could, with the meager means at hand, to create a
naval power there which might be launched against
the blockading fleet outside. There was no navy yard
and no ship-building plant at Charleston, but with an
energy that did credit to the men who exercised it,
several small gunboats and torpedo boats were extemporized
within the harbor and employed with
energy and effect. In January, 1863, two of these
extemporized gunboats boldly steamed out one morning,
and assailed the Federal fleet lying off the harbor.
They promptly disabled two of the Federal
ships, and compelled them to strike their colors. But
the rest of the enormous Federal fleet came quickly
to the rescue and the two little gunboats were forced
to retreat again, and take refuge under the guns of
the forts.</p>

<p>This event gave warning at Washington of the
necessity of promptly and greatly strengthening the
naval force employed off Charleston. Accordingly,
a powerful fleet, consisting of seven monitors, an
ironclad frigate, an ironclad ram and many gunboats
was sent in April, 1863, under command of Rear-Admiral
S.&nbsp;F.  Du Pont, to reduce and capture
Charleston. The expedition failed in its purpose, as
all previous ones sent with a like end in view had done,
and as all future ones did to the very end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
It was on the seventh of April, 1863, that Du Pont,
with his masterful armada, steamed into the harbor
to reduce the forts and to sweep away all the defenses
of Charleston. At every point he found himself under
a destructive fire from forts and batteries occupied
by men who knew how to shoot. At every point
he found his pathway obstructed by chains and torpedoes
and whatever else mechanical ingenuity up to
that period in human history had succeeded in devising
for the checking of an enemy's progress.</p>

<p>One of the Federal ironclads, the <i>Keokuk</i>, ventured
too near Fort Beauregard, manned by Confederate
volunteers who had practised with their cannon
as they might have done with close range rifles until
they could plant a shell wheresoever they desired.
The commandant of the fort did not open fire upon
the vessel until it had securely anchored itself, bow
and stern, in a position from which its officers expected
to make themselves quickly masters of the
work. When they were thus securely fastened in
position the commander of the fort gave the order to
fire. Within the next minute or two the <i>Keokuk</i> was
struck and penetrated by not less than 100 shells,
ninety of which had passed through her sides below
the water line and burst within her engine rooms.
She went down as a cracked teapot might have done.</p>

<p>Another ironclad, the <i>Weehawken</i>, had been sent
to lead the way, pushing a raft before her in order to
explode all contact torpedoes before reaching them.
As soon as she became involved in the chain and other
defenses of the harbor a terrific fire was opened upon
her and for half an hour she was threatened with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
fate of the <i>Keokuk</i>. At the end of that time she
retired, baffled and beaten, and DuPont, seeing how
completely his effort had failed, abandoned the purpose
of taking Charleston or reducing its defenses
by any sea attack. Nearly all of his vessels had been
so far damaged as to be unfit for further use until
repairs in them could be made. Most of the monitors
had been completely disabled for effective action by
the smashing of titanic shells against their turrets,
which were bent and twisted in such fashion that they
could no longer be revolved. Many of the ships of
less formidable character had been altogether withheld
from action in view of the terrific effectiveness
of the Confederate fire. Finding that even his most
powerful floating fighting machines were unable to
resist the fire of the forts Du Pont wisely reserved
his weaker vessels and kept them out of a contest in
which they were so manifestly unfit to engage.</p>

<p>Thus came to an end the best planned and most
capably conducted effort that was at any time made
to conquer Charleston by sea. It was obvious from
that time forth that if Charleston was to be taken at
all it must be captured by other means than those of
a flotilla attempting to force its way into the splendidly
defended harbor.</p>

<p>With that patience and persistence which are dominant
characteristics of the American mind the authorities
at Washington set themselves at once at
work to devise and use those other and slower, but
more hopeful means of conquest. General Quincy
A. Gillmore was assigned to this work. A large
force was placed under his command and whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
guns he needed were subject to his requisition. The
monitors and other naval vessels were ordered to coöperate
with him and act under his direction.</p>

<p>His plan was quickly and intelligently formed.
Charleston lies upon a tongue of land between the
Ashley and Cooper rivers which, uniting at the battery,
form the bay exactly as the union of the North
and East rivers does at New York. Indeed, a map
of Charleston in outline differs from a map of New
York only in one important particular, that the widening
of the peninsula in its middle part occurs on one
side in Charleston and on the opposite side in New
York. South of the Ashley river the coast line sweeps
in a semicircle trending northwards and bounded by
James Island. That island is separated from the
mainland by Wapoo Cut, which connects the mouth of
the Ashley river with Stono Inlet. Stono Inlet separates
James Island from John's Island and the
mainland on the south, and its entrance is from the
sea. On the eastern side of James Island there is an
inlet known as Folly river which has many ramifications,
and which in its general course cuts off from
James Island a marsh known as Folly Island. This
marsh lies along the ocean front very much as Sandy
Hook does at the mouth of New York harbor. A
narrow and shallow creek cuts Folly Island in two
towards its northern end, and the space north of that
creek is known as Morris Island. The northern end
of Morris Island abuts upon the entrance to the harbor
and commands it on the one side while Fort
Moultrie on Sullivan's Island commands it on the
other. Fort Sumter, built upon an artificial island in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
the middle of the harbor, forms the third point in the
triangle in which the Federal fleet had encountered
such difficulty, and suffered such defeat.</p>

<p>General Gillmore's plan was to capture Morris
Island, and gain possession of its northern extremity,
known as Cummings's Point, where stood Battery
Gregg, on guard against entrance to the harbor.</p>

<p>By an error in judgment the Confederates gave
him his opportunity. They withdrew from the marsh
known as Folly Island, where they might have defended
themselves almost to the end of time. Gillmore
was quick to see their mistake, and to take advantage
of it. He instantly seized upon the southern
end of Folly Island, and set to work to convert his
troops into amphibians. In boats, on rafts and by
wading through indescribable mud he pushed them
northward to Morris Island.</p>

<p>In anticipation of this movement on his part, the
Confederates had strengthened a battery on that
island, and named it Fort Wagner. They had armed
it with the best they had in the way of heavy guns,
light guns and infantry forces of grandly desperate
courage and determination. Here was to be fought
out the question of the possession of Morris Island
and the control of Charleston harbor.</p>

<p>The fighting in front of that work was, from the
first, desperate in the extreme. In order to approach
it at all the Federal troops were forced to wade waist
deep in water, carrying their rifles above their heads.
The first assault was made on the eleventh of July,
1863, and was aided by a terrific fire from the fleet.
It was led by the first regiment of negroes that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
thus far actively participated in fighting in the war,
and the conduct of those troops was worthy of the
best traditions of battling. The assault was met in
such fashion as to destroy the greater number of the
assailants and hurl back the fragmentary remains of
the column in confusion. So desperate was this endeavor
and with such determination was the assault
made that the Federals lost more than 1,500 men
while inflicting a loss of less than one hundred upon
their adversaries.</p>

<p>Having failed in direct assault General Gillmore
determined to take Fort Wagner and the works north
of it by regular siege approaches. General Gillmore
was an engineer of the highest capacity and a soldier
of the utmost courage, energy and determination. He
drew his first parallel and mounted great siege guns
upon it almost immediately. Then working under
such cover as he could provide he established a second
parallel, and opened fire from it on the twenty-third
of July. He was advancing in this slow and perilous
way over a narrow strip of land&mdash;a mere marsh
scarcely at all elevated above the level of the surrounding
waters. His sick list was from the first
enormous, and day by day it grew as one man after
another succumbed to the poisonous miasms of those
pestilential swamps in which, until the time of the
war no white man had ever dared spend a night between
the first of June and the end of November.
"Country fever"&mdash;believed by many physicians to be
nothing less than yellow fever in its native and endemic
form&mdash;slew far more of his troops than the
shot and the shell and the bullets of his adversary did.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
Nevertheless, like the soldier that he was, Gillmore
pressed on, working his way inch by inch toward the
hostile embankments.</p>

<p>Toward the last his lines were swept by a fire from
a battery on James Island and by a cross fire of infantry
and sharpshooters from a point in Fort Wagner
itself. With the ingenuity of an accomplished
engineer he protected his men against these special
dangers by bringing up tubes of boiler iron through
which the men were able to do their mining, moving
them forward at night, in order to cover the space
excavated by day.</p>

<p>In all the war no more desperate work was done
than that of both the Federals and Confederates on
the face of Fort Wagner. The fire was incessant and
whether it came from siege guns, from field pieces,
from rifles or from pistols held in the hand, it was all
at pistol shot range. And it was all murderous in its
effects. Yet on neither side was there for one moment
a sign of flinching by day or by night. Many
scores of men were shot through the body as they
slept, and at no moment of the twenty-four hours
was any man secure against this danger.</p>

<p>Little by little Gillmore got his great guns into
position for breaching his enemy's works. The moving
of each gun into its place cost scores of lives and
every attempt to fire it must cost other scores. But
here was work that must be done, and here were men
resolute enough to do it.</p>

<p>On the seventeenth of August the great guns
opened against Fort Wagner and Fort Sumter.
Night and day for a full week the terrible conflict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
continued. The walls of Fort Sumter were beaten
into an amorphous mass of bricks and mortar, its
guns were dismounted and its men dwelt ceaselessly
under the fire of Gillmore's terrible instruments of
death. Nevertheless, they stood firm, and held their
position without faltering or failure. It is to be observed
that the terror of this struggle was due to the
fact that the men on the one side and on the other
were of unconquerable spirit, and indomitable courage,
and that to them the measure of danger served
only to set a measure for endurance.</p>

<p>It should be stated here that in spite of the ruin of
Fort Sumter's defenses, the Confederates continued
to occupy that work, driving off several assaults that
were afterwards made upon it. A little later Major,
afterwards Brigadier General, Stephen Elliott, of
South Carolina&mdash;a man almost womanly in his delicacy
of demeanor, but lion-like in courage and activity&mdash;was
sent to take command of the little infantry
force which still held the ruins of the fort. With an
enterprise that suggests a creative imagination on
his part, he ordered cargoes of sand bags to be
brought thither by night, and little by little with
these, he reconstructed the frowning walls, and
mounted upon them again the great guns that such
a fort is supposed to carry.</p>

<p>His work was first revealed to the enemy in a dramatic
and poetic way. When the time came for the
Christmas salute in which the foes, as it were, lifted
their caps to each other, the saluting was begun by
the ships of the Federal fleet. One after another, as
they lay in line, they fired the conventional number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
of guns. Then the Confederate batteries took up the
courteous work, each firing its quota. When the last
one on the left of Sumter had fired it was supposed
that the saluting would be continued by the next battery
on the right of that ruined work. It was not
dreamed on either side that Sumter had a single gun
in position. But Elliott's work of reconstruction had
been done. His guns were ready again for the fray.
And in his turn he fired the Christmas salute, to the
astonishment and admiration of all.</p>

<p>Then came one of the graceful courtesies of war.
Under signal orders from the commandant of the
Federal fleet every ship in the squadron dipped its
flag in deference to Fort Sumter.</p>

<p>Here were brave men saluting brave men, and rejoicing
in their courage and their enterprise although
these were antagonistically employed. Perhaps no
incident in all the war better illustrates than this one
does the sympathy that brave men feel for brave
men, irrespective of the lines of conflict drawn between
them.</p>

<p>As he approached Fort Wagner General Gillmore
was forced to work upon ground so low that the
spring tides freely washed over it, and drenched his
working details to their waists. Nevertheless, he
pushed them forward, determined that the work he
had undertaken should be fully done. As his parallels
drew nearer and nearer to the work they were intending
to reduce they came at last upon ground
which had been mined, and planted with destructive
torpedoes. Nevertheless, Gillmore pushed forward
his working parties and multiplied the fire of his mortars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
which dropped shells incessantly into the fort, letting
them fall vertically so that no earthwork might
afford protection against their destructiveness. Under
the glare of powerful calcium lights the work
went on by night as well as by day. During every
minute of every hour in the twenty-four the contest
was continued ceaselessly. The destructive fire upon
the Confederate fort was added to by bringing a
great ironclad warship the <i>New Ironsides</i> close in
shore, and setting her guns at work.</p>

<p>After two days of this fearful conflict Gillmore
was ready with his infantry columns to make that
final rush upon the works by which he hoped to conquer
them. But suddenly, in anticipation of a charge
which they were too weakened to resist with any hope
of success, the Confederates abandoned Fort Wagner,
and withdrew also from Battery Gregg to the
north of it.</p>

<p>This gave Gillmore complete control of Morris
Island clear to Cummings's Point, and as he believed,
made him master of Charleston harbor. In that belief
he sent a fleet of whaleboats packed with infantrymen
to take possession of Fort Sumter. But the
Confederates there resisted with a vigor which destroyed
most of the boats, disabling their crews, and
resulted in the killing or capturing of the infantrymen
who constituted their ship's companies.</p>

<p>It had been the hope of General Gillmore that
when he should thus secure command of the entrance
to Charleston harbor the fleet lying outside would
press in and complete his work by capturing the city.
But in this hope he was disappointed. Admiral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
Dahlgren, who commanded the fleet, knew far better
than Gillmore did the reserve resisting power of the
Confederate batteries within the harbor, and he wisely
declined to push his vessels into a bay which, if he had
resolutely invaded it, would have become quickly a
naval graveyard.</p>

<p>During all this time it had been Gillmore's ambition
to bombard the city of Charleston itself. To
that end in August he had brought up to Morris
Island an eight-inch rifle gun of exceedingly long
range and ordered it planted at a point selected by
himself. The point was one so marshy that for a time
no platform could be constructed that would support
the gun. It is humorously related that the officer
constructing it, having been told to make requisitions
for whatever materials he might need, formally sent
in a requisition for "a hundred men eighteen feet
high." At last, however, by driving piles a platform
was made and the gun, which the men named the
Swamp Angel, was got into position. It threw
thirty-six shells into the city of Charleston five miles
away, and then burst. In order to reach so great a
distance it had been elevated to about 23 degrees. No
gun that was ever constructed other than a mortar,
can long endure firing at so great an elevation.</p>

<p>After his capture of Fort Wagner and Battery
Gregg Gillmore resumed his bombardment of the
city from the latter point, which lies a mile or two
nearer than did the position of the Swamp Angel.</p>

<p>Gillmore had succeeded in capturing what had been
supposed to be the main defenses to the harbor and
the city. He had utterly failed to capture the city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
itself, or in any way to break the resistance which, to
the end, continued to hold the harbor secure against
Federal attack.</p>

<p>During all this time the Federals had been holding
Port Royal and the islands along the coast between
Charleston and Savannah. With strong forces they
had made many advances inland, hoping to break the
railroad line between the two cities and to push
through the open country into the rear of one or the
other.</p>

<p>All of these efforts had failed. Chief among them
was the attempt upon Pocotaligo and Coosawhatchie,
which was made with a force of five thousand men
on the twenty-second of October, 1862. This attempt
was defeated by a meager force of 350 men
reinforced to 700, who stood all day against eight
times their number in defense of a causeway 225
yards long, which ended in a bridge on the Confederate
side. The bridge was torn up by the Confederates
and hour after hour during the long day they
stood to their guns and swept away every column that
was formed to advance along the causeway and rebuild
the crossing.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Campaigns of Chickamauga and Chattanooga</span></span></h2>

<p>While Lee was fighting his tremendous campaigns
in Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania, and while
Grant was battling for Vicksburg, two other armies
confronted each other near the southern border line
of Tennessee. Rosecrans had command of the Federal
forces near Murfreesboro, and Braxton Bragg
was in charge of the Confederates at Chattanooga.
The position of each of these armies was a serious
threat to the other side. If Bragg should be left unoccupied
by his enemy it was easily within his power
to make a dangerous dash towards Cincinnati or
Louisville, while if he should withdraw from Rosecrans's
front there was nothing to prevent that general
from "marching through Georgia," to Mobile or
Savannah or Charleston.</p>

<p>Grant, besieging Vicksburg, asked for reinforcements
from Rosecrans by way of warding off that
blow in the rear which he feared that Johnston might
deliver and at the same time Johnston begged for
reinforcements from Bragg in order that he might
deliver such a blow. Each of the commanders at
Murfreesboro and Chattanooga realized the necessity
of remaining where he was so long at least as his adversary
should remain. The result was that neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
sent the reinforcements for which his brother in the
field was so clamorously calling.</p>

<p>These two armies for a long time stood watching
each other, each waiting for the other to make some
movement that would give it opportunity. In the
meanwhile the cavalry on either side was engaged in
making some of the most picturesque raids that were
at any time made during the struggle. On both sides
the cavalry had by this time learned its business, and
realized its possibilities of independent action in the
enemy's country. The Federal cavalier, Grierson,
swept through Mississippi carrying desolation wherever
he went. The Confederates, Wheeler and Forrest,
rushed hurricanelike through the country north,
battling here and there with such forces as they
met. Gordon Granger and Colonel Streight on the
Federal side were swinging swords almost continually.</p>

<p>The operations of this kind were too many, and
strategically of too little importance to call for detailed
description in a general history of the war.
But two of them were so dramatic in their conduct
and ending that they must be mentioned here. One
of these was the attempt of Colonel Streight with
about 2,000 men to march around Bragg's army, and
cut off his communications. This raid was made
early in April, and Forrest followed it with all the
vigor that usually characterized that general's operations.
The two forces were in constant battle as the
one swept onward and the other followed. Streight
meanwhile was working havoc with Confederate depots
of supplies, with railroad property, and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
possessions of his enemy. Finally on the third of
May, Forrest succeeded in placing himself in a position
where he was justified in demanding the surrender
of Streight's force. He made the demand boldly
and threateningly and Streight surrendered only
to learn after the capitulation was made that the
men under his command really outnumbered those
of Forrest. It was Forrest's boast afterward that in
this case he had "won by a pure bluff."</p>

<p>The other raid which rises into historical importance
was that of John Morgan north of the Ohio. Starting
in July with a force of 3,000 Confederate cavalrymen
and ten guns Morgan crossed the Ohio river into
Indiana, capturing two steamers and using them as
ferryboats. He then swept through Indiana towards
Cincinnati, burning mills and bridges, tearing up railroads,
and spreading terror in his pathway. But
resolution accompanied the terror. Every man in all
that region who could bear a gun turned out to fight
the raiders and to destroy them before they should
succeed in recrossing the river. This was accomplished
at last with the aid of gunboats and steamboats.
Morgan was compelled to surrender a small
remnant of his force, and was sent for safe-keeping
to the Ohio state prison, from which he later escaped
by digging.</p>

<p>All these operations, of course, were subsidiary to
the general purposes of the campaign.</p>

<p>Rosecrans was an exceedingly capable strategist
and upon this occasion, more conspicuously than on
any other during his career, his capacity in that way
was demonstrated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
Bragg occupied Chattanooga, the strategic importance
of which has been explained in an earlier
chapter. The position was practically impregnable
by any form of direct assault; for Rosecrans to have
hurled his army against it would have been an act of
well-nigh suicidal folly. In such an assault he must
have lost ten men for every one of his enemy's men
whom he could hope to put hors de combat. Yet it
was necessary for Rosecrans to get Bragg out of
Chattanooga. In order to do so he pushed a part
of his army southward, threatening an invasion of
Georgia. That state was defenseless except in so far
as Bragg's army defended it. Rosecrans's movement,
therefore, quickly compelled Bragg to withdraw
from his strong and threatening position in
order to head off what he supposed to be that southward
movement that Sherman afterward made, and
that is known in history as "the march to the sea."
As soon as he quitted Chattanooga, Rosecrans occupied
that place about the middle of September.</p>

<p>It was apparently good policy for Rosecrans instantly
and aggressively to follow his foe, and he did
so in spite of the fact that his three corps were dangerously
separated at a time of heavy rains, when
the roads were bad, streams out of their banks, marching
difficult, and promptitude of movement impossible.
In the meantime Bragg had been heavily
reinforced by Longstreet's corps sent out by Lee to
save this situation. Thus strengthened Bragg turned
about with intent to assail his adversary, and perhaps
to destroy him. On the nineteenth of September the
two armies met on the banks of Chickamauga creek.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
There for two days raged one of the great battles of
the war.</p>

<p>Rosecrans brought into the action about 55,000
men and Bragg had perhaps 10,000 more. It was
Bragg who made the attack. As the lines lay, the
Confederate right and the Federal left extended
toward Chattanooga.</p>

<p>Bragg's plan of battle was to fall upon the Federal
left, crush it, bend back the line, and place himself
between the Federal army and its base. There could
have been no better plan of battle formed, but it
was not executed in the best fashion possible. Had
Bragg fully realized the superiority of Longstreet to
his other corps commanders, and still more the superiority
of Longstreet's men who had fought at
Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Antietam and Gettysburg,
he would have placed Longstreet upon his
right, in order that the blow might be delivered with
all that was possible of crushing force. Instead of
that he assigned the force of General Leonidas Polk
to that position. Polk was a West Point graduate,
but soon after graduation he had become a clergyman
of the Episcopal church, and for many years past had
been a bishop in that church. A fact that had more
importance perhaps, was that Polk's men had not
been trained by the experience of Lee's tremendous
onslaughts to the best work of the soldier, and unfortunately
for Bragg, but fortunately for Rosecrans,
that left wing of the Federal army upon which
the main assault was made, was under command of
General George H. Thomas, one of the most determined
fighters on either side during the war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
Under Polk the assault was made loosely, and
without that perfect concert of action which Longstreet,
had he been in command, would have brought
to bear. Thomas met it with obstinate resistance, and
when opportunity offered, with counter attacks that
greatly interfered with Bragg's plans. Nevertheless,
the fighting was obstinate and destructive to both
sides. In the end Polk succeeded in forcing Thomas's
line backwards for a time, but before nightfall the
Federal general had recovered the greater part of his
ground, and when the first day's fighting ended the
position of the two armies was practically the same
that had existed in the morning.</p>

<p>About eleven o'clock on the next morning the battle
was resumed with fury. Polk again assailed Thomas,
and Thomas urgently asked for reinforcements with
which to repel the assault. On that part of the line
the struggle continued for hours with varying and
not unequal success, the advantage lying on the whole
with the Confederates. But later in the day Longstreet,
who commanded the right center of Bragg's
line, made a tremendous assault of that kind which
had been rendered familiar to the fighters in Virginia
by repeated experience. He swept everything before
him. He made a gap in Rosecrans's line crushing
its center, separating its wings from each other
and driving it into confused retreat. Thomas alone
held his force together, and fought the matter out to
a finish. In spite of the fact clearly apparent to him
that Rosecrans was defeated, and three fifths of his
army destroyed, Thomas continued the bloody contest
with a fury that knew no flinching, and hesitated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
at nothing of human sacrifice in the achievement of
its purposes. But for Thomas's obstinacy, skill
and courage the Federal defeat at Chickamauga
would have been a repetition of the disaster at Chancellorsville.</p>

<p>During the night Thomas succeeded in withdrawing
his command, and the Federal army fell back to
Chattanooga, taking refuge behind the fortifications
there. Each army had lost in this struggle from
15,000 to 20,000 men. The exact figures are nowhere
procurable.</p>

<p>Bragg had won a great victory, but he had not succeeded
in regaining possession of Chattanooga. His
enemy held that strong, strategic position. It was
therefore his next task to besiege the foe there, and
either by fighting or by maneuvering to drive him
out of the place.</p>

<p>Two mountain heights, the one known as Lookout
mountain and the other as Missionary Ridge, overlook
the town, and command many of its approaches.
When the battle was over Bragg promptly advanced
and seized upon these heights. By doing so he succeeded
in placing Chattanooga in a state of siege,
stopping the navigation of the river, and cutting off
all of Rosecrans's communications, with the exception
of one highly inadequate mud road.</p>

<p>It is a maxim of military science that the army
which can besiege a position can always capture it in
the end unless the beleaguered place is relieved from
the outside. Chattanooga was relieved from the outside
in an exceedingly quiet, but exceedingly effective
way. Ulysses S. Grant&mdash;at last a major general in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
the regular army and in full command of the western
department&mdash;went thither to supersede Rosecrans
in command. The coming of this one silent
and unostentatious man meant more to the Federal
forces in that quarter than the arrival of half a dozen
army corps would have signified. Grant got to Chattanooga
on the twenty-third of October, 1863, and
set to work at once with his practical common sense to
meet and solve the problems of the situation.</p>

<p>He found the army half starved for lack of routes
of communication with its bases of supply. He instantly
set his men at work to open a new road which
the facetious soldiers named the "cracker line," and
which connected Chattanooga with a point on the
river to which steamboats could come with abundant
supplies. This relieved the Federal army in Chattanooga
of its condition as an army in a state of siege.
It made of it instead an army in the field, well fed,
properly supplied, and ready for march or battle, as
its commander might direct.</p>

<p>Having thus relieved the distresses of the army he
had been sent to command, Grant's next thought was
to employ that army in some profitable way. The
Confederates, strongly fortified, held Lookout mountain
and Missionary Ridge, and stretched their line
for twelve miles across the Chattanooga valley.
Grant decided to dislodge them. He could not do so
with the forces assembled at Chattanooga, but at
last the authorities at Washington had recognized
him as a man worthy to command, and had placed
the entire department under his control, and all its
armies were at his disposal. Grant believed in Sherman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
and mightily trusted him. At every point in
his career where Sherman could be called to his aid
Grant summoned that commander, and employed his
genius as the most effective instrument for the accomplishment
of his own purposes. It is not too
much to say that Sherman was to Grant quite all that
Stonewall Jackson was to Lee&mdash;a lieutenant to whom
he might assign the most difficult enterprises with full
assurance that they would be executed with all the
skill, determination, valor and sagacity that it was
possible to bring to bear upon them as military
operations.</p>

<p>So when Grant determined to dislodge the Confederates
from Lookout mountain and Missionary
Ridge his first step was to summon Sherman to join
him with the corps then under Sherman's command.</p>

<p>Certain military necessities delayed Sherman's
march, and he did not reach the position at Chattanooga
until the fifteenth of November. His arrival
swelled Grant's force to about 80,000 men, while
Bragg's army was weakened by the detachment of
Longstreet with 20,000 men to operate against Burnside,
who was commanding at Knoxville, Tennessee.
The Confederate force in possession of Lookout
mountain and Missionary Ridge was thus considerably
inferior to the army with which Grant prepared
to assail it. But the Confederates were strongly
posted and on a part of their line, at least, they were
well entrenched.</p>

<p>Grant's plan of battle was simple, as his plans of
battle usually were. He ordered Sherman to carry
Missionary Ridge, which constituted the extreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
right of the Confederate position, while Thomas and
Hooker should so far engage the remainder of the
line as to prevent the reinforcement of that point upon
which his chief assault was to be made. If he could
accomplish this Bragg must either retreat, abandoning
his threat against Chattanooga, or he must seek
some point at which to give battle again with a force
so far weakened by detachment as to render battle a
dangerous alternative for him.</p>

<p>Sherman advanced on the twenty-fourth of November.
His assault was repulsed and for the time
unsuccessful. Hooker, in the meanwhile, exceeded
his orders, and did a good deal more fighting than
Grant had intended him to do. It was his assigned
duty merely to engage that part of the Confederate
lines which lay in front of him, sufficiently to prevent
the sending of any force from it to reinforce the Confederate
right. But Hooker was by instinct a fighter
at all times. And on this occasion he pushed his men
boldly into a fight that his commanding officer had
not intended. His force climbed to the extreme summit
of the mountain, passing a zone of mist and fog
as they went. Having reached the summit they
routed the Confederates there and made themselves
masters of the heights. The fact that they passed
through this fog zone on their way up led to the
poetic nicknaming of this action as the "Battle above
the Clouds." It was not, properly speaking, a battle
at all, and it was not above the clouds in the sense in
which that phrase impresses the ordinary mind.</p>

<p>On the twenty-fifth Grant pushed Thomas again
into the fight, and assailed the position on Missionary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
Ridge. A very gallant and very vigorous action followed.
It resulted in the Federals carrying the
Ridge, sweeping everything before them, and driving
Bragg's army into full retreat. He retired with
what remained of his force to Dalton, Georgia, and
almost immediately afterward Gen. Joseph E. Johnston
was ordered to take command in that quarter
in his stead.</p>

<p>The campaign had been dramatic in many of its
features, and peculiarly picturesque in some of them.
It had cost the lives of from six to ten thousand men
on either side. It left the Federals masters of Chattanooga,
placing the Confederates in an uncertain
defensive position against which future operations
were comparatively easy.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Grant's Strategy&mdash;The Red River Campaign&mdash;Fort Pillow, Etc.</span></span></h2>

<p>The operations of the Confederate war covered a
vast area, and included a multitude of actions severe
in themselves, and often rising to the dignity of great
battles so far, at least, as the extent of the slaughter
was concerned. But many of these actions had no
particular bearing or effect upon the general conduct
and outcome of the war. To tell the story of them
all would not only be tedious, but it would make this
history a confused mass of only slightly related details
rather than a consecutive narrative of what happened.
It is necessary, therefore, to summarize many
things which in themselves were dramatic in their
character and of the highest importance to the men
engaged in them.</p>

<p>The detachment of Longstreet to operate against
Burnside at Knoxville has already been mentioned in
the previous chapter. There was some brilliant fighting
there, in which the Federals succeeded in beating
off Longstreet's tremendous assault, but only after
suffering one conspicuous defeat at the hands of the
great Confederate lieutenant. In like manner the
expedition of Banks in command of 40,000 Federals
into the Red River country, west of the Mississippi,
had no important bearing upon the war except in so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
far as it resulted in depriving Grant for a time of
the services of 40,000 veterans whose soldierly vigor
he could have used to much better purpose.</p>

<p>This Red River expedition was inspired by cotton
speculators for their own purposes of greed. It was
intended to enable them to get possession of the great
stores of cotton that lay in Louisiana and Texas.
The expedition consisted of the army under Banks&mdash;a
political general of far better military capacity than
most political generals had&mdash;and a fleet of gunboats
under that noted fighter, Commodore David D. Porter.
Banks's army was opposed by a much smaller
force of Confederates under General Richard Taylor,
who nevertheless defeated it in an irregular
action and drove it into a confused retreat which must
have ended in surrender but for the protection of
Porter's gunboats. Banks retreated painfully along
the margin of the tortuous stream, nowhere daring
to quit the gunboats' support even in order to save
weary miles of marching around the bends in the
river.</p>

<p>This expedition was ordered before Grant took
command of all the armies. It was one of the many
foolish blunders with the results of which the great
Federal commander had to reckon and wrestle when
he came into his own. As the spring of 1864 approached
something happened which was of more importance
to the Federal cause than any battle could
be, or the success of any campaign. Congress and
the administration recognized Grant as the great
leader that he was, and gave him that authority of
command which alone he needed in order to make an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
end of the struggle. On the twenty-sixth of February
a bill passed by Congress revived the grade of
lieutenant general in the army. Grant was promptly
nominated for that office, and confirmed in it by the
Senate on the second day of March. On the third he
was ordered to Washington, and on the ninth Mr.
Lincoln delivered to him his commission as lieutenant
general, with authority to direct the operations of all
the Federal armies in whatever part of the country
they might be stationed.</p>

<p>Oddly enough in thus bringing to the front and
giving command to the only general who had shown
adequate capacity to direct the war to a successful
conclusion, the administration still retained as its
adjutant general that conspicuously incapable person,
General Halleck, who had done more than all other
men and all other influences combined to interfere
with Grant's work in the war, to prevent him from
accomplishing the ends he sought in behalf of his
country, and to fritter away the fruits of his victories
after he had won them. The shade of Winfield Scott
still held in mortmain its strange influence over the
Washington authorities. And General Grant's personal
memoirs&mdash;though they make no complaint of
this absurdity&mdash;very clearly show, that in the gigantic
combinations which he was now called upon to make,
he was often seriously embarrassed by this continuance
of an authority to interfere in many ways with
his plans.</p>

<p>The advent of Grant to the command of all the
armies in the field wrought a revolution instantly and
conspicuously in the conduct of the war. He had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
sympathy whatever with the "pepper box policy."
From the very beginning he had clearly seen that
the strength of the Southern Confederacy lay in the
fighting capacity of its armies. He had clearly seen
that the problems of this war were not mainly geographical&mdash;that
the occupation of this, that or the
other position was of small consequence, except in so
far as it tended to weaken the tremendous fighting
force of that "best infantry on earth" which was defending
Richmond on the one hand, and threatening
Washington on the other.</p>

<p>Now that he had come into supreme command it
was his first thought so to organize and coördinate
all the operations of all the armies as to make them
tend to the accomplishment of one supreme purpose&mdash;namely,
the breaking and crushing of the Confederate
power of resistance. As that power of resistance was
centered chiefly in the Army of Northern Virginia,
and in the genius of Robert E. Lee, Grant's grand
combinations were all directed toward the destruction
of that army, and the baffling of that genius.</p>

<p>As has been said already Grant was preëminently
a man of practical common sense, and to his mind
military problems were like any others that present
themselves to the human mind&mdash;that is to say, they
were problems, to be solved by the use of the means
at command in the most effective way that could be
thought of. War was to him like any other business.
He knew that the administration had at its command,
in men, money and materials, resources immeasurably
superior to those which the South could control. It
was his purpose to avail himself of that superiority in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
every way possible. In all that involved considerations
of humanity or courtesy he had the delicate
sentiments of a tender-hearted and generous man.
But in the conduct of war he did not permit sentiment
for one moment to interfere with common sense.</p>

<p>The strategy with which he undertook to fight the
war out to a finish was simple. His "objective" was
always the army opposed to him, and not merely a
geographical position. In all his orders to all his
lieutenants he emphasized this incessantly. In order
to end the war he must crush the Confederate armies,
and to that effect he instructed Sherman and every
other commander under his orders.</p>

<p>Grant established his headquarters in Virginia in
order that he might give personal direction to the
operations of the Army of the Potomac. He did this
with a most delicate consideration for Meade, who had
direct command of the Army of the Potomac, and
whose devotion and capacity he trusted implicitly, as
he has himself testified in his memoirs.</p>

<p>It was his simple plan of campaign first to prevent
Lee's reinforcement from any quarter, and secondly
to hurl all the force he could concentrate against
the Army of Northern Virginia for the purpose of
destroying the resisting power of that army. In his
judgment it was more important to cripple Lee than
to capture Richmond. And in his judgment, also, to
cripple Lee was to make the capture of Richmond
easy and certain.</p>

<p>In order that Lee might not be reinforced, Grant
began by issuing orders for vigorous operations in
every other part of the Confederacy. He ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
Banks to withdraw from his wasteful cotton-seeking
expedition up the Red river, to return to New Orleans,
and to move thence against Mobile. He ordered
Sherman to press back the Confederates in
northern Georgia toward Atlanta, directing him to
seize that town, and push on to the Gulf, thus again
cutting in twain what remained of the Confederacy.</p>

<p>The military situation at this time could not be
more clearly set forth than it was by General Grant
himself, in his memoirs written long afterwards. In
aid of a clear understanding his exact words are
quoted here:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Mississippi river was guarded from St. Louis to
its mouth; the line of the Arkansas was held, thus giving
us all of the northwest north of that river. A few points
in Louisiana, not remote from the river, were held by the
Federal troops, as was also the mouth of the Rio Grande.
East of the Mississippi we held substantially all north of
the Memphis and Charleston railroad, as far east as Chattanooga,
thence along the line of the Tennessee and Holston
rivers, taking in nearly all of the State of Tennessee. West
Virginia was in our hands; and that part of old Virginia,
north of the Rapidan and east of the Blue Ridge we also
held. On the sea coast we had Fortress Monroe and Norfolk
in Virginia, Plymouth, Washington and New Berne in North
Carolina, Beaufort and Folly and Morris Islands, Hilton
Head, Port Royal and Fort Pulaski in South Carolina and
Georgia, Fernandina, St. Augustine, Key West and Pensacola
in Florida. The balance of the southern territory,
an empire in extent, was still in the hands of the enemy.
Sherman, who had succeeded me in the command of the
military division of the Mississippi, commanded all the troops
in the territory west of the Alleghanies and north of Natchez,
with a large movable force about Chattanooga.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span></p>
<p>In the east the opposing forces stood in substantially the
same relations towards each other as three years before or
when the war began. They were both between the Federal
and Confederate capitals. It is true footholds had been
secured by us in Virginia and North Carolina, but beyond
that no substantial advantage had been gained on either
side.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>That portion of the Army of the Potomac not engaged in
guarding lines of communication was on the northern bank
of the Rapidan. The Army of Northern Virginia, confronting
it on the opposite bank of the same river was strongly
entrenched, and commanded by the acknowledged ablest general
in the Confederate army.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The Union armies were now divided into nineteen departments,
though four of them in the west had been concentrated
into a single military division. The Army of the Potomac
was a separate command, and had no territorial limits. There
were thus seventeen distinct commanders. Before this time
these various armies had acted separately and independently
of each other, giving the enemy an opportunity often of
depleting one command, not pressed to reinforce another
more actively engaged. I determined to stop this. To this
end I regarded the Army of the Potomac as the center, and
all west to Memphis, along the line described as our position
at the time, and the north of it, the right wing; the Army
of the James, under General Butler (with headquarters at
Fortress Monroe), as the left wing, and all the troops south
as a force in rear of the enemy. Some of these latter were
occupying positions from which they could not render service
proportionate to their numerical strength. All such
were depleted to the minimum necessary to hold their positions
as a guard against blockade runners; where they could
not do this their positions were abandoned altogether. In
this way 10,000 men were added to the Army of the James
from South Carolina alone, with General Gillmore in command.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
Officers and soldiers on furlough, of whom there
were many thousands, were ordered to their proper commands;
concentration was the order of the day.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>As a reinforcement to the Army of the Potomac, or to
act in support of it, the Ninth army corps, over 20,000 strong,
under General Burnside, had been rendezvoused at Annapolis,
Maryland. This was an admirable position for such a reinforcement.
The corps could be brought at the last moment
as a reinforcement to the Army of the Potomac, or it could
be thrown on the sea coast south of Norfolk, in Virginia or
North Carolina, to operate against Richmond from that
direction.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>My general plan now was to concentrate all the force possible
against the Confederate armies in the field. There were but
two such, as we have seen, east of the Mississippi river, and
facing north. The Army of Northern Virginia, General
Robert E. Lee commanding, was on the south bank of the
Rapidan, confronting the Army of the Potomac. The second,
under Joseph E. Johnston, was at Dalton, Ga., opposed to
Sherman, who was still at Chattanooga. Beside these main
armies the Confederates had to guard the Shenandoah valley,
a great storehouse to feed their armies from, and their
line of communications from Richmond to Tennessee. Forrest,
a brave and intrepid cavalry general, was in the West
with a large force, making a larger command necessary to
hold what we had gained in middle and west Tennessee. We
could not abandon any territory north of the line held by
the enemy, because it would lay the Northern states open to
invasion. But as the Army of the Potomac was the principal
garrison for the protection of Washington, even while
it was moving on Lee, so all the forces to the west and the
Army of the James guarded their special trusts when advancing
from them, as well as when remaining at them.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Accordingly I arranged for a simultaneous movement all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
along the line. Sherman was to move from Chattanooga,
Johnston and Atlanta being his objective points. Crooke,
commanding in West Virginia, was to move from the mouth
of the Gauley river, with a cavalry force and some artillery,
the Virginia and Tennessee railroad to be his objective.
Sigel was in command in the Valley of Virginia. He was
to advance up the Valley, covering the North from an invasion
through that channel, as well by advancing as by
remaining near Harper's Ferry. Every mile he advanced
also, gave us possession of stores on which Lee relied. Butler
was to advance by the James River, having Richmond and
Petersburg as his objective.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Banks, in the department of the Gulf, was ordered to
assemble all the troops he had at New Orleans in time to
join in the general move, Mobile to be his objective.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now for the first time in the entire history of the
war a single masterful mind was in control of all the
operations of all the vast armies of the United States,
and was trying to direct all those operations with
singleness of purpose to a foreordained end. The
coming of Grant into command thus marks an epoch
in the history of the war.</p>

<p>Some of his lieutenants did their work incompetently,
thus in a degree baffling his purpose, but in
the main those whom he had wisely selected for command
did that which he required of them in masterly
fashion. Sigel, who was to advance up the Valley of
Virginia, and break the communications between
Tennessee and the Confederate capital, failed utterly.
In profound disgust, General Grant received from
Halleck a dispatch saying, "Sigel is in full retreat
on Strasbourg. He will do nothing but run; never
did anything else."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
Banks also failed to place his army of 40,000 men
at New Orleans in time to help in the grand strategy
which Grant had inaugurated.</p>

<p>Butler got himself "bottled up," as General Grant
phrased it, on the south side of the James river, so
that while he held a strong defensive position there,
he was unable to employ his troops aggressively with
effect. But the rest of Grant's subordinates&mdash;and especially
Sherman&mdash;carried out their orders with brilliant
capacity and tremendous effect.</p>

<p>While Grant was thus preparing for his grand
campaign, the Confederates were not idle. With
forces greatly inferior in number and equipment,
and with an exhausted country behind him, Lee stood
upon the defensive, waiting to see what his adversary
might undertake, and what opportunities might open
themselves to him for offensive defense.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile that most active and tireless of
campaigners, General N.&nbsp;B.  Forrest, went upon a
raid in West Tennessee and Kentucky which, for a
time, seriously threatened an invasion of the North
and a disturbance of General Grant's plans. Sweeping
northward like a hurricane, Forrest captured the
Federal garrison of 500 men at Union City in Tennessee,
wrecked railroads in every direction, and
pushed his column daringly to Paducah, Kentucky,
on the banks of the Ohio, fifty miles above Cairo.
Sherman sent all his cavalry and other available
troops to check this movement, and if possible to
make an end of Forrest by capturing him and his
force. But Forrest was too quick for him. Rapidly
falling back, he assailed the Federal fort on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
Mississippi river, known as Fort Pillow. That fortress
was held by negro troops, and the Southerners
had never yet consented to regard the employment
of such troops as legitimate in this war.</p>

<p>Here it is necessary to explain. The enlistment of
negroes in military service was no new thing in
American war. During the Revolution, and even
before it, the statutes of South Carolina and of some
of the other colonies specifically provided for such
enlistments, and in South Carolina, at least, the law
made it an offense for the master of any slave to
refuse his service to the country as a soldier. Again
during the war of 1812&ndash;1815, Andrew Jackson made
free use of vigorous young negroes, enlisting them
as soldiers wherever he could find them, and appealing
to their patriotism to support with manly determination
the independence of the only country they
could call their own.</p>

<p>But in the Confederate war a different condition
of affairs existed. From the beginning of the
struggle the Confederates employed negroes to work
upon fortifications, and although they did not enlist
them as soldiers, this employment of them amounted
to much the same thing in so far as it released an
equal number of enlisted men for active work in the
field. So general was the prejudice against any and
every recognition of negro equality at the North as
well as at the South, that many newspaper writers at
the North&mdash;ignorant of the history of their own
country with respect to the military employment of
negroes&mdash;bitterly denounced all this, insisting that
the Confederates were employing savages in arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
against a civilized enemy. That plea was apt to be
an effective one in this country, for the reason that
from the beginning of the colonial struggles until
the end of the war of 1812&ndash;1815 it had been one of
America's grievances against Great Britain that
agents of the mother country had mercilessly employed
Red Indian savages in murderous warfare
upon the white men.</p>

<p>When, later in the war, it was decided at the North
to arm and use as soldiers such able-bodied negroes
as might be induced to volunteer, the recruits were
naturally drawn in the main from the large companies
of runaway slaves who had escaped into the
Federal lines. This fact gave to the military employment
of negroes against the South the aspect of
an attempt to create a servile insurrection and war&mdash;the
one thing which had been always most dreaded
in those states in which the negroes outnumbered the
whites. Servile insurrection was understood to mean
rapine, the burning of homes, the butchery of women
and little children, and all else of horror that savage
warfare may signify. The Southerners therefore
held the enlistment of negroes in the Northern armies
to be an act of unforgivable vandalism and savagery.
They peremptorily refused to recognize the negro
anywhere as a soldier, or in case of his capture to
treat him as a prisoner of war.</p>

<p>In execution of that purpose of absolute and unflinching
historical truthfulness which the author of
this work has tried to make his only inspiration, it
must be said that in many cases, and particularly on
occasions of raids into undefended country, certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
of the negro troops did many things to justify the
Southern view of the iniquity of their employment
against white men. In regions undefended they frequently
committed outrages of a kind which the instincts
of humanity never forgive.</p>

<p>It is proper here to emphasize again the fact to
which the present historian directed earnest attention
in a work published in 1874&mdash;namely, that throughout
the war, when all the Southern white men were
in the field, and when all the plantations with the
women and children inhabiting their homes were unprotected,
the negro slaves who remained upon the
plantations were affectionately loyal and obedient,
nowhere instituting insurrection or in any other wise
betraying the trust reposed in their fidelity and affection,
and this in spite of the fact that they perfectly
knew that the failure of the South in the War must
result in their own emancipation. Emphasis is here
given to this fact in order that nothing recorded concerning
the atrocities committed by certain negro
troops shall impair or reflect upon the negro character
generally.</p>

<p>But from beginning to end the Confederates refused
to recognize the right of their enemy to enlist
their runaway slaves in the war against them. From
first to last they refused to regard negroes as soldiers,
entitled to be treated as such. So returning to our
theme, it must be said that when Forrest found Fort
Pillow garrisoned chiefly by negro troops, even had he
desired it to be otherwise, he could not have prevented
the slaughter that ensued. His men simply
would not make prisoners of war out of negroes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
arms, and the result of the struggle was a Federal
loss of about 500 killed together with nearly all their
officers, while the Confederates according to Forrest's
report lost only about twenty men. In his
dispatches, written at that time of excitement, Forrest
said, "It is hoped that these facts will demonstrate
to the Northern people that negro soldiers cannot
cope with Southerners." His words have since been
construed to mean a blood-thirsty antagonism to the
negroes. That construction may be correct, but General
Forrest himself contended to the end of his life
that he meant only to point out the ease with which
Southern soldiers conquered and destroyed this negro
force as illustrating the inefficiency of black men in
fighting white men. That meaning would seem to be
the only one which it is necessary to give to the language
of his dispatch.</p>

<p>Other minor operations during the period of preparation
for the tremendous struggle of 1864 were
carried on in different parts of the South with results
that had no important bearing upon the general
course of the contest or upon its outcome. These
operations need not be more particularly mentioned
here.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Grant's Plan of Campaign</span></span></h2>

<p>As the month of April neared its end Grant prepared
to execute the plans he had so laboriously
formed, and for which he had given to all his lieutenants
in every quarter of the country orders as minute
as they could be made without risk of leaving any
lieutenant embarrassed for want of liberty of action
in the event of an emergency.</p>

<p>For the sake of a clear understanding let us state
again in brief outline his scheme of operation. His
fundamental conception was that in order to conquer
the Confederacy he must destroy its armies in the
field, and especially Lee's army, which had been from
the first the chief source and center of danger to the
Federal cause, both by reason of its superb fighting
quality, and by reason of the masterful genius of Lee
that directed it. Grant's first care, therefore, was so
to employ all the subsidiary forces in all quarters of
the South as to prevent the sending of any reinforcements
to Lee.</p>

<p>His second fundamental idea was to fight the Confederate
armies in the open field rather than assail
them in defensive works at the points of chief strategic
importance.</p>

<p>Certain writers for the press have severely criticized
the great Federal commander for having wasted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
thousands of lives in his march overland upon Richmond
instead of transferring his army to the front
of that city by water as he might easily have done
without the loss of a man. This criticism is ignorant
in the extreme, but as its conclusions persist in spite
of Grant's own, and many other intelligent replies, it
seems necessary to say again that his purpose was not
to reach the front of Richmond, but to encounter, and
if possible, to crush Lee's army in the field. It is
perfectly true that he might have placed the Army of
the Potomac in front of Richmond and Petersburg
without any battling or any loss of life, just as McClellan
had done in 1862. But in that case his task
would have been to assail the greatest general of the
Confederate army, the greatest engineer of modern
times, and the strongest fighting force of the South
in positions of their own choosing, defended by the
most formidable defensive works that ingenuity could
construct. It was Grant's idea, and a perfectly sound
one, that he could not afford this&mdash;that this was the
longest and most difficult instead of the shortest and
easiest road to the accomplishment of his military
purposes. He had two men to Lee's one; he could
get two more for the asking where Lee could not get
another one. He wisely decided, therefore, that if
possible he would compel Lee to fight in the open
field, instead of confronting him in defensive works.
It was not certain that he could compel Lee to this
course. But it was his purpose to do so if possible,
and in the end he succeeded in achieving that possibility.</p>

<p>Rightly interpreted, there was no greater strategy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
in all the war than this. Yet nothing has been more
misunderstood or more injuriously reported. In his
uncertainty as to whether Lee would accept battle in
the open field, or would fall back upon Richmond
and defend that city behind strong earthworks, Grant
prepared himself for either contingency. He ordered
Butler, with a strongly reinforced army, to move
up the southern side of James river, supported by the
gunboats, and to establish himself in an unassailable
position, from which, in case of Lee's declining battle
in the open, he might threaten or assail the southern
and eastern defenses of the Confederate capital, while
Grant, with the Army of the Potomac, might fall
upon that city from the North, thus bringing to bear
against Lee a combined force three or four times as
great as his own.</p>

<p>But his strong hope was that Lee would accept
battle in the field, and that the Confederate general
might be so far crippled there by the assaults of overwhelming
numbers as to be far less formidable in his
final defense of Richmond than he must be if forced
back to that position by maneuvering and without
fighting.</p>

<p>If there was any error or miscalculation in General
Grant's plan for the destruction of the Confederacy
and the ending of the war, that error was in underestimating
the tremendous fighting force of the Army
of Northern Virginia, under command of Robert E.
Lee. Grant had never met Lee in battle, and had
learned of his capacity and of the resisting power of
the army under his command only by hearsay. These
were so much greater than anything else of the kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
that had been known in the war that Grant's mistake,
if he made any mistake, was surely pardonable. He
had reckoned rightly in supposing that Sherman could
deal successfully with Johnston, could take Atlanta,
and could push his army thence to the sea, again cutting
in twain what remained of the Confederacy.
Perhaps he had not fully appreciated the resisting
capacity of Lee with his Army of Northern Virginia.
Perhaps he had a trifle too confidently reckoned upon
numbers as a means of crushing that force. At any
rate in his tremendous campaign from the Wilderness
to Petersburg, he did not conquer it or crush it. So
far indeed did he fail to do this, that after Lee had retired
to Richmond and Petersburg and there confronted
Grant's enormously reinforced army, the
Confederate general was able to reinforce Early in
the valley and send him on an expedition northward
which threw Washington again into a panic, and for
a time threatened the compulsory withdrawal of a
part of Grant's forces from the siege of Richmond
and Petersburg.</p>

<p>In all his plans Grant calculated, as he had an entire
right to do, upon an enormous superiority of
force, whether measured by the number of men under
his command, or by the extent of equipment, or by
the perfection of his supply departments or by the
limitless reinforcement which he was privileged to call
to his aid, where his adversary was forbidden by
strenuous circumstance, to add a single brigade or
regiment or company or man to his fighting force.</p>

<p>It was his plan to hurl against Lee a force so overwhelming
that in the ordinary calculations of war it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
should crush him completely. To that end he ordered
Meade on the twenty-seventh of April to advance
with his entire army from the position he occupied
near Bull Run to the Rappahannock. On the same
day he ordered Burnside, who lay at Annapolis with
20,000 men, to advance and occupy Meade's former
position, thus bringing to bear the whole of the forces
in northern Virginia as a column of offense against
Lee.</p>

<p>At the same time Grant ordered Butler to push up
on the south side of the James river, and secure a
strong and threatening position in rear of the Richmond
defenses. Reinforcements were held ready to
go to Butler's aid in the event that Lee should fall
back upon the defenses of the Confederate capital.</p>

<p>On the same day Sherman was directed from
Grant's headquarters to mass his forces and begin
that splendid advance against Johnston and Atlanta,
which was intended first to neutralize and then to destroy
the only great Confederate army other than
Lee's which remained in the field. Other and minor
operations were ordered from the Valley of Virginia,
from West Virginia, from eastern Tennessee, from
New Orleans and from other points, all of which
were intended to accomplish two purposes&mdash;one of
them the interruption of Confederate communications,
and the other to prevent the sending of any
reinforcements to Lee.</p>

<p>General Grant has himself frankly stated in his
"Memoirs," page 419, that "to get possession of Lee's
army was the first great object. With the capture of
his army Richmond would necessarily follow." Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
we have the purpose of the campaign in a nutshell.
If General Grant could have succeeded in capturing
Lee's army or destroying it in the field, there is no
possible doubt whatever that Richmond would have
followed, as he said, and the Confederate resistance
would have ended early in the summer of 1864. For
Sherman's operations against Johnston, Atlanta and
the far South were completely successful, as we shall
see hereafter. The resisting capacity of the Confederacy
was prolonged solely through the fact that
Grant's hope of quickly capturing or destroying
Lee's army was baffled for the time, and postponed
to another year.</p>

<p>General Grant has himself explained the immediate
strategy employed by him in his campaign in
northern Virginia. He had his choice between two
courses,&mdash;either to move continuously by his own left
flank around Lee's right, thus keeping always at his
back that great system of waterways beginning in
the Rappahannock and Potomac, and stretching on
to Fortress Monroe and the James, and maintaining
at all times in his rear a perfect and unassailable base
of communications and supplies; or, on the other
hand, to move by his own right flank around Lee's
left, as Hooker had tried to do, thus threatening the
Confederate communications, and forcing Lee, as
it were, into a pocket. Should he adopt this second
course, however, he must carry with him all that he
needed of ammunition and food supplies, and expose
his own communications to possible rupture at any
hour by daring operations on the part of the Confederate
forces. He determined, therefore, to move by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
his own left, assailing Lee's right and keeping the
waterways always at his back.</p>

<p>The plan was simple and effective. It is true that
it left some advantages to Lee&mdash;unmolested communications
and short lines of march&mdash;but these were
more than offset by the other considerations involved.
From beginning to end of the struggle Grant found
no occasion to change his method in the least.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Battles in the Wilderness</span></span></h2>

<p>With the coming of May, 1864, the two great commanding
geniuses of the War&mdash;Lee and Grant&mdash;met
each other in conflict. The exact forces commanded
by each have never been ascertained. But the estimates
of the various writers on the subject, North
and South, do not differ sufficiently, to make their
differences of much consequence. In round numbers
Lee had, on the Rapidan, about 66,000 men.
The army with which Grant opposed him numbered
approximately 120,000. These estimates do not include
either the Confederate forces defending Richmond
and Petersburg on the one hand, or Butler's
strong army south of the James on the other. Lee
had called Longstreet back from the region of Atlanta,
and had thus in effect massed all the force that
he could hope to employ in that campaign. With
this force substantially half as large as that of his
adversary, he determined to accept Grant's offer of
battle in the field. To that end he moved his army
on the second of May to the western edge of that
peculiar region known as the Wilderness. There he
awaited the coming of Grant.</p>

<p>This Wilderness, it should be explained, is a region
of peculiar difficulty by reason of the tangled mass
of second growths which have replaced the original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
forest, cut away a century or more ago as fuel for
iron works. In extent the region is about a dozen
miles wide in either direction. It borders the Rapidan,
and extends to the open country in front of
Chancellorsville, where the battle of that name had
been fought a year before.</p>

<p>At midnight on the third of May the Army of
the Potomac crossed the Rapidan on five pontoon
bridges, and marched at once into the Wilderness,
where it remained during the whole of the fourth in
order that its enormous train of 4,000 wagons and
the reserve artillery of more than 100 guns might be
protected in their passage across the river. It was
Grant's hope to move by his left flank, out of the
Wilderness, passing around his enemy, and placing
himself with all his force between that enemy and
the Confederate capital. But with that promptitude
which was characteristic of all his operations, Lee
anticipated this movement and struck at Grant's
flank early on the morning of the fifth.</p>

<p>The assault was made in the midst of the Wilderness&mdash;in
a thicket so dense that it was impossible at
many points for the men on one side to see those on
the other, a hundred feet away. Every forward or
backward movement involved a struggle through a
tangle of vines and underbrush and young forest
growths so thickly standing as to render all progress
difficult, and all regularity of formation impossible.
On either side no corps or regiment or company could
know what its own friends were doing on its right or
its left; no officer could tell whether he was being
supported on his flank or had been abandoned there;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
no steadiness or cohesion was possible. No alignment
could be maintained. It is doubtful to-day that
any officer on either side in that struggle, from Grant
and Lee at the top to the smallest commander at the
other end of the line, ever had a clear-cut idea of the
course that that day's fighting took. It consisted of
a series of irregular assaults made with desperate
valor, and repelled with equal determination. It resembled
nothing so much as a battle in the dark, the
one thing which all commanders most dread, and most
sedulously avoid.</p>

<p>Very naturally the fighting was at short range at
every point. Scarcely anywhere on that tangled
field did the opposing forces discover each other's
positions until they came within short pistol-shot
range. The slaughter was therefore tremendous and
at no time could either commanding general fully
satisfy himself as to how the battle was going or
what its result was likely to be or even what his own
or the enemy's position was.</p>

<p>The two greatest fighting machines that America
has yet produced had met in battle, in the midst of
such a maze of tangled growths as nowhere else exists
except in marshes where such a meeting is impossible
by reason of a lack of firm ground for the men to
stand upon. Here at least, there was firm ground.</p>

<p>Grant had not expected to encounter his enemy
here. He had supposed that Lee would move out of
the Wilderness and choose more favorable ground
upon which to receive the assaults of his enemy. Accordingly,
the Federal commander had already
pushed a part of his army under Hancock toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
the edge of the Wilderness, hoping by a rapid march
to place it between the Confederate army and the
Confederate capital. No sooner, however, was Lee's
assault developed than Grant saw clearly that he must
fight a determined battle here on this most unsuitable
ground. Lee had decided this in the obvious expectation
of finding Grant unready. But readiness under
all circumstances was a part and an important part
of Grant's character and intellectual make-up. It
was his habit of mind to take things as he found them
and to do the best he could in every case. He hurriedly
called Hancock back and accepted battle in
the jungle.</p>

<p>The fighting was desperate throughout the day,
and at the day's end no decisive advantage rested
with either party. Lee had been fighting with only
a part of his army, for the reason that Longstreet
with that first corps upon which Lee always relied for
the more desperate work of war did not reach position
in time to take part in the struggle of that day.</p>

<p>At nightfall it was obvious that the contest must
be resumed in the morning and indeed, each of the
great commanders intended that it should be, each
planning to strike first if possible. In preparation
for the coming morning's work both sides spent the
night in diligent fortifying with such means as were
at hand.</p>

<p>Grant ordered an assault all along the line to be
made at five o'clock in the morning. Lee, still more
alert, struck out with his left an hour earlier. He
was still weak on his right wing, for lack of Longstreet,
who had not yet come up. Grant, recognizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
this fact, planned to hurl Hancock upon the Confederate
right at the appointed hour of five o'clock
in the morning. By an adroit handling of Rosser's
cavalry, the Confederates managed to deceive Hancock
into the belief that Longstreet was making a
flank movement against the Federal left, similar to
those which Jackson had made with such destructive
effect in former battles. To meet this and to avoid
a disaster like that which had befallen Hooker at
Chancellorsville, Hancock promptly detached a considerable
part of his force, and sent it to his left, thus
weakening his column of attack.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he struck hard enough to drive back
the weak Confederate right for more than a mile.
Then Longstreet, who had undertaken no such flanking
expedition as that which Hancock had supposed,
came up and threw his veterans precipitately upon
his foe.</p>

<p>These two&mdash;Longstreet and Hancock&mdash;were both
old fighters and very stubborn ones, and they had
under their command the very best men there were
in their respective armies. When they met in direct
conflict at close quarters, therefore, the fighting was
as obstinate as any that had yet occurred on any field
since the beginning of the war.</p>

<p>Hancock was driven back and the losses on both
sides were great, including a conspicuously large loss
of officers from the lowest to the highest grade. General
Wadsworth on the Federal side, and General
Jenkins on the Confederate, were killed, and Longstreet
himself was shot through the neck and shoulder
so that he had to be carried from the field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
Having thus lost his great lieutenant, General Lee
went to that quarter of the field and took personal
command in Longstreet's place. It was then that
one of the most picturesque incidents of the war occurred.
Impressed with the desperate necessity of
carrying a certain peculiarly difficult position, General
Lee seized the colors of a Texas regiment and
undertook to lead the perilous assault in person. The
troops loudly protested against such an exposure of
their beloved general to danger, and the Texas
colonel, in behalf of his men and amid their applause,
solemnly promised that they would carry the point at
all costs and all hazards if Lee would go to the rear.
Finally, Lee's bridle rein was seized, and he was forcibly
taken to the rear, while the Texans advanced to
the charge with the battle cry of "Lee to the rear!"
upon their lips. The incident has been exquisitely
celebrated in song by the poet John R. Thompson.</p>

<p>Under inspiration of this incident, the Confederates
made an assault of desperate determination, and
at one point broke through the Federal lines. They
captured the position for the recovery of which Lee
had sought to sacrifice himself, but the result was
achieved at tremendous cost of life, and their further
efforts to dislodge Hancock were bloodily repelled.</p>

<p>By some means&mdash;probably by reason of the fierce
firing on either side&mdash;a forest fire now broke out in
Hancock's front, and the flames quickly communicated
themselves to the log revetments of his fortifications.
The heat and the smoke forced the
Federals to retreat, fighting as they went against the
Confederates who pursued them with fury. Sadly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
enough, besides the dead there were large numbers of
wounded men, both Federal and Confederate, lying
among the burning bushes and underbrush of that
mile-wide stretch of wilderness over which the flames
swept. Here misfortune and sheer accident wantonly
added to the necessary horrors of war another
horror not contemplated or intended by either commander
although that, like all other risks of battle, is
included in the contract which the soldier makes with
his country. These men, wounded and helpless as
they lay amid the flames that circled and enwrapped
them, must have realized as nobody unaccustomed to
the horrors of war can, the truth of Sherman's statement
that "war is all hell."</p>

<p>Night ended the struggle, and the men on both
sides retired to their entrenchments to await the
events of the morrow. On neither side was there the
least suggestion of demoralization or of shrinking
from the work that was yet to be done. On neither
side were there skulkers in the rear as there had been
at Manassas, at Shiloh and at nearly every other great
battle of an earlier time. The volunteers who composed
the armies of the Potomac and Northern Virginia
were real soldiers now, inured to war, and
desperate in their determination to do its work with
out faltering or failure. This fact&mdash;this change in
the temper and morale of the men on either side&mdash;had
greatly simplified the tasks set for Grant and Lee to
solve. They knew their men. They knew that those
men would stand against anything, endure slaughter
without flinching, hardship without complaining, and
make desperate endeavor without shrinking. The two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
armies had become what they had not been earlier in
the contest, perfect instruments of war, that could be
relied upon as confidently as the machinist relies upon
his engine scheduled to make so many revolutions per
minute at a given rate of horse power, and with the
precision of science itself.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that as Jefferson Davis approached
the battlefield of Manassas, where the Confederates
had won a conspicuous victory, the multitude
of panic-stricken fugitives through whom he
passed was such as to convince him that Beauregard
had been disastrously defeated. It will be remembered
that at Shiloh when Grant made his way to the
front he was appalled by the presence under shelter
of the river banks of a multitude of fugitives, demoralized
and panic-stricken, who ought to have been
at the front lying on their bellies and firing at the
enemy. Nothing of the kind occurred on either side
at the Wilderness. The war school had perfectly
educated its pupils.</p>

<p>The losses in these two days of fighting in the
Wilderness have never been accurately ascertained,
and never will be. The best estimates fix them at
about 15,000 or 16,000 men on either side. These
losses included, as has already been said, a remarkable
number of officers of high grade on both sides. Nothing
could be more significant than this of the determination
with which the battle was fought.</p>

<p>In the strictest sense of the military term this had
been a drawn battle. Neither side had overcome the
other and neither had driven the other into retreat.
Yet each side has claimed it as a victory upon grounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
which are logical enough in themselves. The Confederates
held that by checking Grant and baffling
his plan of marching out of the Wilderness, and forcing
Lee to a fight in the open, they had accomplished
a very distinct victory. The Federals held, that, as
they had succeeded in placing their army securely
south of the Rapidan and in a position to carry on a
further campaign, and that as they had not been so
far damaged in the fight as to feel themselves under
compulsion of retreat, they were entitled to regard
the general result of the two days' fight as a victory
for themselves.</p>

<p>There is no doubt whatever that at the end of this
struggle the Confederates expected Grant to retire
to the northern side of the river, as all his predecessors
had done after similar conflicts. When the next
morning dawned and Grant still stood firm in their
front they were astonished to find him there. Among
the men no explanation of his continued presence in
the wilderness was forthcoming. In the mind of Lee
there was an explanation ready and sufficient. The
great Confederate general is reported to have said
to his staff on that morning, "Gentleman, at last the
Army of the Potomac has a head."</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_XLVI" id="CHAPTER_XLVI">CHAPTER XLVI</a><br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Spottsylvania and the Bloody Angle</span></span></h2>

<p>All day during the seventh of May the two armies
lay still. There was a little cavalry fighting at Todd's
Tavern, but the two great armies did not again engage
each other in conflict. They had tried conclusions
here, and each was measurably satisfied with the
result.</p>

<p>The question now was where next they should meet
each other in arms. Lee had chosen the field of the
first onset. It was for Grant to choose the next.
And in pursuance of his strategy Grant determined
to move by his left flank to Spottsylvania Court
House, hoping to reach that position before his adversary
could get there, and to seize upon its best
strategic points. In that position he would still have
the great waterways at his back as a support, and
a trustworthy source of supply. His desire was
throughout the campaign to thrust his army in between
the Army of Northern Virginia and Richmond,
and this seemed to be his best opportunity to
do so. He had somewhat a shorter line of march, and
moreover by taking the initiative he was able to start
first. If he was baffled in the attempt it was only by
reason of the alertness of Lee's genius which penetrated
his purpose, grasped his thought, and promptly
acted in contravention of it.</p>

<p>Spottsylvania Court House lay fifteen or sixteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
miles southeast of the Wilderness battlefield, and
nearly that far southwest of Fredericksburg. In
order that the movement might be made without danger
of his army being attacked while in motion,
Grant adopted the plan of using the troops on his
right as the advance force of his movement towards
the left. He did this throughout that campaign by
the left flank, always withdrawing the forces on his
right, passing them in rear of his main army, and thus
making of the movement what is technically known
as a countermarch. In this way the advancing troops
had always the main army between them and the
enemy until they cleared the position occupied, and
were well on march toward the new one aimed at.
After that, of course, they must take care of themselves,
but in the meanwhile the march was begun
without discovery on the part of the enemy.</p>

<p>The movement on this occasion was begun at nine
o'clock in the evening, on the night of Saturday, May
7. With his extraordinary alertness and penetration
Lee anticipated it and obstructed it. He threw a
force of cavalry across the roads that Grant's head
of column must traverse, and directed it to oppose
and delay the movement so far as it was possible to
do so. He also sent sappers and miners ahead to fell
trees across the road over which Grant must march,
then with caution, but with boldness, he set his own
columns in motion, sending the head of them to seize
upon and hold the strongly strategic positions at
Spottsylvania until such time as Grant's movement
should so far develop itself as to justify him in moving
his whole army into that position. The Federal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
cavalry had occupied these strategic positions before
the Confederates got there, but they were quickly
brushed away, and by the time that the head of
Grant's column of infantry and artillery reached
Spottsylvania, Lee's advance was in full possession
and everywhere throwing up earthworks. The remainder
of Lee's forces were quickly brought up, as
were those of Grant, and the two great armies again
confronted each other, each with set lips, determined
to get the better of the other if human resolution
could accomplish that purpose.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Grant had sent Sheridan with a
strong force of cavalry to ride around the Confederates
as Stewart had thrice done around the Federal
army, to disturb their communications, and obstruct
their avenues of retreat in case of disaster. His
movement was promptly met by the Confederate
cavalry under their great leader J.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B.  Stuart, and
the two forces fell a-fighting at a point known as the
Yellow Tavern, seven or eight miles north of the
city of Richmond. There in fierce conflict Stuart
met the death which he had always declared that he
longed for. He was mortally wounded at the head
of his men while making one of those tremendous
onsets which it was the pride of his soul to conduct.
With Stuart disabled, the Confederate cavalry was
left without a leader capable of making the most of
its dash and prowess, and Sheridan succeeded in
breaking through the outer lines around Richmond,
but not in going farther. He retreated and rejoined
the army under Grant on the twenty-fifth of May,
seventeen days after the time of his setting out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
The first casualty of importance at Spottsylvania
was the killing of General Sedgwick by a Confederate
sharpshooter. This one sharpshooter had already
sent his bullets through twenty men as the Federals
were trying to establish themselves in position. So
deadly was his aim that in spite of the distance he
seemed to be able to hit anybody that he shot at. After
a little experience with him the men who were
engaged in erecting fortifications shrank from their
work, and General Sedgwick rebuked them, saying
that at such a distance the best sharpshooter couldn't
hit an elephant. A moment later he fell dead pierced
through by a bullet from the sharpshooter's rifle.</p>

<p>By the evening of the ninth of May the two armies
confronted each other, each behind its breastworks.
A little fighting of a severe character occurred that
evening on the Confederate left, both sides losing
heavily, and neither gaining any advantage of moment.
On the next day the fighting was renewed
with desperation upon both sides. Several times the
Federalists reached the Confederate breastworks, and
held them for a few moments, but upon every occasion
they were driven back. In their retreat they
carried away some prisoners, some battle flags, and
other trophies, but none of the guns that they had
temporarily captured.</p>

<p>Thus the fighting on the tenth of May resulted in
no advantage to either side. Grant had failed completely
in his effort to place himself at Spottsylvania
in advance of Lee, and thus to thrust his army in
between Lee and Richmond, compelling the Confederate
general to make a race for it under disadvantageous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
circumstances, and by a longer line than that
which Grant must follow. Thus when the fight began
at Spottsylvania Lee was still between Grant
and Richmond, and the fighting itself was an attempt
to dislodge him by assault, by an army outnumbering
his by two to one or more.</p>

<p>On the eleventh of May throughout the day and
night it rained incessantly, and enormously. The
whole earth in that region was converted into a quagmire
impracticable for the movement of artillery, and
almost impassable even by infantry. Lee's men in
the trenches were forced to stand upon fence rails
and sticks and whatever else they could get to keep
themselves from sinking to their knees in the glutinous
red clay, softened as it was by the rain. It was
impossible even to send couriers with orders in the
rear of either line in the rain, and so the orders were
passed, particularly during the night, by word of
mouth, from one man to another up and down the
lines. The conditions were of a kind to try the courage
and endurance of soldiers far more severely than
either battle or hard marching could. Yet through
it all these veterans on either side maintained their
courage and resolutely refused to let even the rains
of that Virginia springtime wash the starch out of
their stamina.</p>

<p>The two lines were so near together at many points
that pickets could not be thrown out even into the
rifle pits which are customarily placed between works
thus closely confronting each other. It was impossible
to see for any distance in any direction, and at
all hours of that terrible night there was a constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
threat of sudden advance and surprise upon one
point or another of the Confederate line. These
threats were reported by word of mouth, as has been
explained, from one soldier to another along the line.
A message would come "Look out on the left," or
"Look out on the right; enemy advancing." About
two o'clock in the morning, after there had been a lull
of half an hour in the tremendous downpour, the
rain began again in bucketsfull and some wag in the
Confederate lines started a message, "Get out of the
wet." In spite of their discomforts, of their fatigue,
of their exhaustion from sleeplessness, and of their
momentary danger, the gallant fellows took it up and
passed it from one to another, as they might have
passed any order of General Lee's. This incident is
related here merely by way of showing into what
condition of cheerful endurance the men had been
wrought by their soldierly experience. It is of value
as showing what stuff these contesting armies were
made of in the spring of 1864, when the issues of the
war lay in their hands.</p>

<p>The Confederate line at one point presented what
is known in military parlance as a salient angle,&mdash;that
is to say, a bend, the point of which projects toward
the enemy, so that the enemy advancing toward it,
and upon either side of it, has the advantage of
shooting down along the lines of the men defending
it on either side. This is called enfilading, and it especially
endangers a position of the kind. Grant decided
to begin the fighting on the twelfth by an early
assault upon this Confederate salient. During the
night he carefully disposed his forces with a view to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
this operation, hoping thus early in the morning to
break through the Confederate line, cut it in two and
assail each of its divisions in rear and at disadvantage.</p>

<p>In this operation he was greatly favored by a dense
fog, which rendered it impossible for his enemy to
discover his movements, or even the presence of his
moving columns at a greater distance than a few
yards. Hancock had charge of this particular movement,
and he succeeded before his movement was discovered
in gaining a position very near to the exposed
salient angle, and from that position his men rushed
with a wild hurrah upon the works. The Confederates
stood their ground as such veterans were at that
time always expected to do.</p>

<p>Hancock's men climbed over the breastworks, and
the fighting that ensued was that of desperadoes in
mortal conflict. They were foes of a sort that knew
no flinching and no fear. They fought hand to hand.
They thrust each other through with bayonets. They
brained each other with clubbed muskets. Cannoneers
on the Confederate side finding the infantry
support inadequate used their rammerheads, their linstock
points, and even the handspikes of their guns
with deadly effect. Those of the artillerymen who
had none of these instruments to use did that which
is not often done in war. They drew their short artillery
swords&mdash;blades resembling the bowie knife in
shortness&mdash;and fought with them to the death.</p>

<p>So sudden was the onset and so overwhelming was
Hancock's force that in spite of its desperate resistance
the small Confederate body holding the salient
was overcome, and the greater part of it captured.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
It consisted of General Edward Johnson's division
of about 3,000 men, together with twenty guns, which
were immediately turned upon such of the Confederates
as had succeeded in avoiding capture.</p>

<p>Flushed by this success, and believing that they
had finally broken the Confederate line, Hancock's
men pushed on towards Spottsylvania Court House,
until they encountered a second line of entrenchments,
which, in spite of rain and fog and mud had
been thrown up during that night of storm across the
rear of that dangerously salient angle. Those entrenchments
were manned by the flower of Lee's
army, and they quickly brought to nought the triumphant
march of an enemy who had supposed that
his hard work was, for the time being, done,&mdash;that the
Army of Northern Virginia was broken in two, and
must seek safety in flight.</p>

<p>It was here more conspicuously than anywhere else
in all the history of the war that the superb staying
power of Lee's veterans was illustrated. At the
salient their line of battle had been successfully
broken, but at a brief distance in rear of the salient
that line of battle stood fast and irresistible to any
assault that even Hancock's victorious veterans might
make upon it. Here we have a single fact which
might be multiplied many times over, which serves to
show how and why it was that this contest of 1864
was from beginning to end so bloody and so determined.
The time had come when the morale of both
armies was perfect, and when each was invincible, except
by the pressure of utterly overwhelming force.
The time had come when the Americans who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
fighting on those Virginia fields were perfect soldiers,
immeasurably superior in stamina, in courage, and in
devotion to any regulars who were ever drilled into
obedience and endurance in any country of the world,
before or since. This, the historian believes to be a
simple statement of fact which should be recorded in
history and not forgotten or overlooked by those persons,
who in the twentieth century shall study the
story of what Americans did during the first hundred
years of the Republic's vigorous life.</p>

<p>But the fighting already described was only a
shadowy beginning of that which was presently to
follow. The Confederates were not content with
having hurled back Hancock's assault at the base of
their captured salient, but were determined to retake
the salient itself, although the difficulty of doing so
was appalling. What had been a salient angle in
possession of the Confederates became a reëntering
angle as soon as it was held by the Federals. For the
Confederates to push their force into it was for them
to encounter a destructive fire from either side, not
only enfilading their lines, but sweeping them from
front and rear at the same moment. Nevertheless,
and with a courage too splendid to be fitly characterized
by any adjective in the language, they promptly
followed Hancock's men as the latter retired under
pressure to the entrenchments of the salient angle.
At that point the Federal troops leaping over the
works to their own side of them, used them as their
own in the defensive operation. Time after time&mdash;five
times in all&mdash;the Confederates pressed forward,
enduring the bloodiest slaughter in their attempt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
retake the angle, amid a fire of hell from the front,
both flanks and diagonally from the rear. All day
long this struggle was continued. The Confederates
in spite of the slaughter, and despite all their disadvantages,
forced their way, step by step, back to the
captured works, and there fought hand to hand over
the small embankment with their enemy on the other
side.</p>

<p>The embankment itself was a frail structure of
logs, from which the rain had washed away the
greater part of the earth that was intended to give it
a power of resistance against fire. Huddled on
either side of it&mdash;the Federals on the one side and
the Confederates on the other&mdash;they fought over and
through it, throughout the hours of that terrible day.
Sometimes they thrust their bayonets through the
crevices in the log barrier, and thus ran each other
through. Sometimes they fired through those crevices
upon enemies less than ten feet away. Sometimes
the men on one side or the other would suddenly
mount upon the small parapet, and with bullet or
bayonet, assail their adversaries on the other side.</p>

<p>This spot in the annals of the war is fitly called
"The bloody angle at Spottsylvania." The fighting
there lasted throughout the day and until after midnight
of the twelfth. It was a fighting of blind fury
from beginning to end. It was such a struggle as
few wars have ever given birth to, and it illustrated
in the most conspicuous way imaginable that American
heroism which made our war so terrible in its conduct,
and so glorious in its memory. At every point
in the bloody angle when the fighting was done dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
men lay piled, one upon another, sometimes five deep.
Wounded men were often imprisoned under the
dead, unable to extricate themselves, at a time when
there were none to rescue them. Every bush and
every sapling that constituted the thicket there was
cut away by a stream of bullets, as grass is before a
mower's scythe. Even an oak tree nearly two feet
thick was worn in two near its base by the continual
and incessant stroke of leaden balls until it fell,
crushing some of the Confederates who were fighting
beneath its branches.</p>

<p>Is not the question a pertinent one&mdash;what did the
little charge of the six hundred at Balaklava amount
to as an exhibition of human heroism in comparison
with such a fight as this? Has the age of poetry
passed? And have the poets forgotten their cunning
that not one of them has ever yet celebrated in song
such American deeds as these, or as Pickett's charge
at Gettysburg, or as Grant's assault at Cold Harbor,
or as the six matchless advances of the Federals upon
Marye's Heights at Fredericksburg? Or is it merely
that our poets have been embarrassed by the very
richness of our Confederate war in deeds of derring-do?</p>

<p>On neither side have the losses in this struggle at
the death angle been separately computed with even
such tolerable accuracy as might justify the historian
in the use of round numbers. But the slaughter,
it is certain, was as terrific as at any other point of
fighting during the entire war, with the possible exception
of Cold Harbor, a little later.</p>

<p>After midnight the Confederates withdrew from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
the apex of the angle to their second line at its base,
and for that day the fighting was over.</p>

<p>Concerning this struggle Dr. Rossiter Johnson in
his "History of the War of Secession" has written a
sentence so wise and so just that no apology is needed
for incorporating it in the text of the present work.
He wrote, "If courage were all that a nation required,
there was courage enough at Spottsylvania, on either
side of the entrenchments, to have made a nation out
of every state in the Union."</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Cold Harbor and on to Petersburg</span></span></h2>

<p>A week of desperate fighting had convinced Grant
that he could not break through or overlap or force
back Lee's stubborn line of defense at Spottsylvania.
After another week devoted to a study of the problem
the Federal commander decided to make another
movement by his left flank, similar to that which he
had made from the Wilderness. He had in the
meantime replenished his supplies of food and ammunition,
and in spite of continuous fighting in a
small way throughout the week of pause, he had succeeded
in reorganizing such of his forces as had been
broken, and in resting those of them whose previous
exertions had been most exhausting.</p>

<p>On the nineteenth the Confederates under Ewell
sharply assailed the Federal right, and a considerable
conflict ensued. But in its proportions it was insignificant
as compared with the fighting done a week
before.</p>

<p>Grant's next objective point was the North Anna
river at or near Hanover Court House. He moved
one corps at a time, keeping them twelve hours apart,
by way of confusing his enemy, and if possible bringing
on a fight in the open field before Lee could have
time to throw up those hasty entrenchments which
had hitherto, slender as they were, given him a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
advantage in the struggle. This hope was disappointed.
Lee was too wily a strategist not to perceive
and avoid his enemy's purpose. Moving
hurriedly and upon a somewhat shorter line than
Grant's he reached and crossed the North Anna before
Grant got there, and so established his line that
Grant could not assail it without dividing his own
army into three parts, each separated from the others
by a bend of the river, and each in danger of
being crushed before it could be supported. There
was some severe fighting at this point, involving a
loss of two or three thousand men on either side, but
nothing occurred that could be called a pitched battle,
or that deserves more than a mention in comparison
with the other splendid contests of that campaign.</p>

<p>Having satisfied himself that there was no thoroughfare
here, Grant determined upon a still further
movement by his left flank, similar to those already
made. He moved on the night of the twenty-sixth,
and finding Lee still in his pathway he almost immediately
moved again, his destination now being
Cold Harbor. The Confederates promptly moved
in the same direction, and the two armies met at various
points in sharp conflict, but no general action
resulted. In the end they came face to face at Cold
Harbor with Lee again behind hastily constructed
breastworks.</p>

<p>Lee instantly called to his aid all the troops that
could be spared from the defenses of Richmond, less
than ten miles away, while Grant brought heavy reinforcements
for himself from Butler's army, south
of the James.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
Again Lee had beaten his adversary in a race to
secure the commanding ground at the place of meeting.
He had placed his army in a position where it
could be assailed only in front, and the men, who had
learned the use of spade and shovel as expertly as they
already knew the use of the bullet and the bayonet,
had been favored by the nature of the soil in throwing
up a line of breastworks which they felt themselves
competent to hold against any assault. Lee's
right rested on the Chickahominy river, and his left
upon a maze of little streams between which there
were impracticable swamps. The river in his rear
was at that season very low and easily fordable at
almost any point at which a crossing might be attempted,
so that it offered no barrier to a retreat of
the Confederates, if retreat should be forced upon
them. Best of all, as a source of confidence to Lee
was the superb morale of his army. It might be possible
for an enemy to carry his works and force a way
through his lines though that was exceedingly improbable
in view of the stubbornness with which his
Confederates had learned to fight. But even should
that improbable thing be accomplished, Lee perfectly
knew that his men would none of them run away, but
that they would stand fast by their colors, and fall
back fighting to the works before Richmond. The
time had completely gone by when panic or demoralization
was to be reckoned upon as even a possible
factor in either of these two veteran armies. They
had both of them thoroughly learned the trade of
war. They were both composed of as good human
material as was ever employed in the construction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
an army. They were both commanded from top to
bottom by officers who knew their business, and were
disposed to do it at their best.</p>

<p>Here, then, were all the conditions for a great
battle and it was for Grant to determine whether or
not that battle should be fought. His critics have
contended that he should have determined that question
in the negative&mdash;that the position of Lee was
too strong to invite direct assault, or to offer his
assailant a tolerable chance of victory. It was at
any rate certain, that no assault could be made which
would not involve tremendous slaughter among the
assailants, while no assault unless successful beyond
any promise that the conditions held forth could possibly
inflict upon the Confederates any compensating
loss, even if reckoned upon the arithmetical hypothesis
that Grant could afford to lose two or three men
to his adversary's one.</p>

<p>Writing near the end of his life, General Grant
said in his "Memoirs":</p>

<p>"I have always regretted that the last assault at
Cold Harbor was ever made.... At Cold Harbor
no advantage whatever was gained to compensate for
the heavy loss we sustained. Indeed the advantages
other than those of relative losses were on the Confederate
side."</p>

<p>But the assault was made. In spite of the adverse
conditions, Grant determined to assail Lee there, and
if possible to force a passage through his lines. It
should be explained that during all these movements
the two armies had kept themselves always within
striking distance of each other, and that conflicts between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
them had occurred at every step&mdash;conflicts
which earlier in the war would have been reckoned as
battles of great moment, but which at this stage of the
struggle were regarded merely as passing incidents
of a campaign marked by tremendous battles. At
Cold Harbor there was very heavy fighting on the
second of June, when Lee took the offensive and
bent back the right of Grant's line, thus greatly
strengthening the Confederate position of defense.</p>

<p>The great battle came, however, on the morning
of the third of June, just as the darkness of night
began to gray into the dawn. There was no strategy
employed in this action. There was nothing in it of
tactics, grand or petty. As one historian has said, it
was a fierce battle depending for its results "upon
the brute strength of the forces engaged." Grant
simply hurled nearly his whole army against Lee at
a single point. The fighting covered scarcely more
than a brigade front of Lee's line, and upon that
short front Lee promptly concentrated troops until
they stood six deep at the breastworks, the men in
rear loading rifles, and passing them to those in front
to fire. The Federals were advancing against strong
earthworks, and through a tangled mass of abattis
or trees felled with their branches toward the enemy,
and with their limbs sharpened to obstruct a march.</p>

<p>The action lasted scarcely more than twenty minutes.
Yet in that brief time Grant lost, according to
his own report, 10,500 men, or at the rate of more
than five hundred men per minute, or nearly ten men
per second. When General Lee sent a messenger to
General A.&nbsp;P.  Hill, who commanded at that point,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
to ask for a report of the results Hill pointed to the
dead bodies of Federal troops piled high upon each
other, and for answer said, "Tell General Lee it is
the same all along my front."</p>

<p>The Confederate loss in this action was reported
at about 1,000 men.</p>

<p>This was the most staggering blow that Grant had
ever received in battle, and the news of it appalled
the authorities at Washington, and greatly depressed
the people throughout the North. That a little army
like Lee's, reduced by this time to less than 50,000
men, should have inflicted such a defeat upon an adversary
whose forces were generally estimated at
120,000 men seemed to those persons who do not understand
the conditions of battle to indicate a lack
either of commanding capacity on the part of General
Grant or of fighting capacity on the part of the
army under his command.</p>

<p>Both of these judgments were clearly mistaken.
It was perhaps an error on General Grant's part to
assail Lee in his strong position at Cold Harbor, but
it was a mistake prompted by that boldness which so
often achieves conspicuous results in war. In criticizing
such operations it is always necessary to bear
in mind that "war is a hazard of possibilities, probabilities,
luck and ill luck." At Cold Harbor there
was, to say the least, a possibility that Grant, with
his overwhelmingly superior numbers, might break
through the Confederate lines, and force his way into
Richmond. There was the hazard of such failure as
that which the Federal army in fact met with. For
the sake of the possibility Grant accepted the hazard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
Had he won there would have been nothing but praise
throughout the North for a boldness which had
achieved so conspicuous a success. As he lost in the
hazard instead, there was bitter criticism which has
not ceased even unto this day.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the Federal cause, the administration
at Washington had at last learned that uniform,
continued, and complete success is a thing not
to be expected of any commander in the field. The
administration, therefore, did not withdraw its confidence
from Grant or put some other in his place
because Lee had thus far baffled him in his endeavors,
or because in this instance he had met with bloody
defeat at Lee's hands. As for Grant himself, he was
always a man of calm mind in no way given to
hysterical exaltations on the one hand, or morbid depressions
of spirit on the other. He accepted his
defeat at Cold Harbor as a mere incident in a campaign
which he was determined to carry on to the end
in the best way he could.</p>

<p>The campaign had now endured for almost exactly
one month. During that time Grant had lost about
60,000 men and 3,000 officers. Lee's loss has been
estimated at about 18,000 men, with a proportionate
number of officers. The campaign in the field was
now practically over, and it remained for Grant to
settle his army before Richmond and Petersburg as
a besieging force. The object of the campaign in
the field, as we have seen, and as General Grant has
himself declared, was to crush Lee's army if possible,
and failing that to cripple it for defense before his
own siege of the Confederate capital should begin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
He had succeeded, though at enormous cost to himself,
in reducing the numerical strength of his adversary
by about one third. Such reduction was undoubtedly
less than he had hoped for, but at any rate
it was something to the good, so far as his operations
were concerned, and it left him in better case for the
beginning of that siege during which, as he well
knew, he could limitlessly reinforce himself while his
adversary had no reserves anywhere to draw upon,
even sufficiently to make good those daily losses which
defensive operations of necessity involve.</p>

<p>After a week of waiting in indecision Grant determined
upon his plan of future operations. He
decided that to assail Richmond from the north or
east was rendered hopelessly impracticable by the
demonstrated alertness of Lee in always interposing
the Army of Northern Virginia between the Army
of the Potomac and its objective. Halleck proposed
from Washington that Grant should place himself
on the north and east of the Confederate capital, and
conduct siege operations from those directions, thus
carrying out that traditional and paralyzing policy
which had prevailed during the whole of Halleck's
term of command, of keeping the Army of the Potomac
always interposed between Lee and Washington.
If Halleck had been still Grant's superior in command,
there is no doubt that he would have insisted
to the end upon this plan of operations, dictated as
it always had been by an overweening anxiety lest
some Confederate force should succeed in entering
the Federal capital city. Grant was a man of very
different type. He was not given to fearful imaginings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
He saw no reason why those in charge of
Washington city&mdash;fortified and armed to the teeth as
that city was&mdash;should not themselves defend the capital
against any force that Lee might spare from in
front of the Army of the Potomac, so long as that
army should continue its operations against the Confederate
general with vigor, determination and ceaseless
activity. He decided, therefore, to transfer his
army from the northern to the southern side of the
James river, to seize upon Petersburg, if that should
prove possible, to invest that town, if it could not be
taken by assault, and by continued movements to the
left to cut off Lee's communications.</p>

<p>Here a little geographical explanation is necessary.
Petersburg lies on the Appomattox river, twenty-two
miles due south of Richmond. It was connected with
Richmond by a line of railway and this line was extended
from Petersburg southward, by way of Weldon,
North Carolina. The Weldon railroad constituted
Lee's main line of communication with the
coast country south of him. From Petersburg west,
extended another line of railway to Lynchburg and
beyond, while from Richmond a third line, the Richmond
and Danville road, extended southwesterly to
Danville, crossing the south side railroad at Burkesville,
or as the place was more familiarly known, the
Junction.</p>

<p>These three lines of railway constituted Lee's sole
means of communication with the country south and
west of Richmond. It was Grant's purpose, while
holding Lee rigidly to his defensive works, to push
his own columns around Lee's right and into his rear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
threatening and ultimately cutting these three lines
of communication.</p>

<p>Grant hoped so far to conceal his purposes from
his wily adversary as to take Petersburg by surprise
and capture it, thus at once and easily breaking two
of the three lines of Confederate communication, and
gaining possession of a position which McClellan
two years before had seen and declared to be the
military key to Richmond. In aid of this purpose
of surprise he set men at work, throwing up fortifications
to the north of Richmond, and sent large bodies
of cavalry to operate destructively on the north and
west of that city, while he held at and near Cold Harbor
a sufficiently threatening line in Lee's front to
give the impression that he had determined upon
making his siege approach in the same way in which
McClellan had sought to take the city two years before.
He transferred his base of supplies to the
White House on York river, where McClellan's base
had been.</p>

<p>Then he began his movement upon Petersburg.
Sending a large part of his force by water, he moved
the rest across the James river by pontoon bridges,
all his operations being beyond sight of the Confederates.</p>

<p>In his effort to take Petersburg by surprise he was
very nearly successful. At the beginning of the
movement he had Butler under his command and well
placed south of the James river, with an army of
30,000 men. In anticipation of his own movement
with the main army, he ordered Butler to advance
at once upon Petersburg, capture that place, and hold
it until the Army of the Potomac should come up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
This was a bold movement, and one altogether well
planned. But Butler's advance was met at Petersburg
with determination by the small force present
there, aided by the home guards of elderly men, and
men otherwise unfit for the regular service. These
men, though unused to the work of the soldier, did
that work well until they were slowly driven back
and forced to fight in the streets of the city itself.
But before Butler could bring up his main body to
support the attack he had made with the head of his
column, Beauregard arrived upon the scene with a
small force of Confederate veterans from the south.
That always active commander at once fell with fury
upon the Federal advance, and drove it back to the
hills outside the city, where, during the night a slender
line of earthworks was hastily thrown up by the
men with their bayonets, and such spades and shovels
as could be found in the city.</p>

<p>In the meantime Lee had penetrated Grant's design,
and as usual had met it with celerity and promptitude.
Marching his men at a double quick which
would speedily have killed off two thirds of them if
they had been in less perfect training than they were,
he pushed them into Petersburg, and out upon the
hills that guard the city in time to meet Grant there
in a strong position which diligent labor quickly rendered
stronger with earthworks.</p>

<p>Thus began that historic siege of Petersburg which
was destined to last for many months, and which
was marked daily by that heroism of endurance on
both sides which is after all, more admirable than the
heroism of dash and daring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
The story of that siege will be told in a later chapter.
Meanwhile other events had been occurring in
other quarters, some account of which must first be
given in order that the reader shall fully understand
the course and progress of the war during that fighting
summer of 1864.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Confederate Cruisers</span></span></h2>

<p>From the beginning of the war the Federals had
enjoyed the very great advantage of having possession
of a navy, and of shipyards in which that navy
could be increased almost at will, while the Confederates
had neither ships nor shipyards. On the Federal
side it was easily possible to increase the naval force
by drawing into the service available vessels of every
kind&mdash;steamers, merchantmen, tugs, and even double-ender
ferry boats from New York Harbor. The
guns with which to arm these vessels were at hand,
and they were quickly made ready for service by
slight alterations which the shipbuilders of the North
were prepared to make at exceedingly short notice.
On the Southern side there was next to nothing in this
way. For a time the Norfolk navy yard was in the
possession of the Confederates, and as we have seen
in a former chapter they availed themselves of its
working resources so far as to prepare the <i>Merrimac</i>
or <i>Virginia</i>, and send her out into Hampton Roads,
upon her mission of destruction. But presently a
change in the military situation made it necessary for
them to blow up that ironclad ship, and they had no
means of providing another to take her place. At
Charleston two or three ironclad gunboats were constructed,
together with several torpedo boats that did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
more or less execution; but so inadequate were the
means of construction on the southern side that these
boats accomplished very little. On the Mississippi
some rams were created out of old hulks, which did
some execution, but which were speedily destroyed.</p>

<p>On the open sea the Confederacy had no ships of
its own afloat, except the <i>Sumter</i>, a sailing craft
heavily sparred, and commanded by Raphael Semmes,
perhaps the most expert sailor and daring fighter
among all the men who had resigned from the Federal
navy to engage in the Confederate service. That
ship, daringly commanded and daringly maneuvered,
wrought havoc for a time in the early part of the war,
but the days of her usefulness as against steam craft
were easily numbered.</p>

<p>Somewhat later a steam vessel, the <i>Alabama</i>, was
built at Birkenhead in England for the use of Captain
Semmes and his daring crew. She was a little
thing, only 220 feet long, and built of wood with no
protection whatever against an enemy's fire. But
she was fleeter than any ship in the American navy,
and it was hoped by the Confederates that she might
destroy the commerce of the United States upon the
high seas without herself meeting with destruction.
In spite of the protests of the American minister in
London, this ship, all unarmed, was permitted to escape
to sea, and at Fayal in the Azores her cannon
and coal were put on board of her.</p>

<p>For nearly two years she made herself a terror to
American merchantmen, and was the despair of the
American navy, which had no ship capable of steaming
one half so fast as she could do. In effect she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
swept American commerce from the seas, not so much
by her captures of American merchantmen as by her
perpetual threat of capture which rendered it a bad
speculation for any American merchant to send a ship
to sea, and thus subject her to the possibility of capture
by the <i>Alabama</i>.</p>

<p>In June, 1864, the <i>Alabama</i> put into the harbor of
Cherbourg, France. The <i>Kearsarge</i>, a United States
war vessel under command of John A. Winslow, lay
off the harbor, waiting for the <i>Alabama</i> to come out.
The one vessel could not attack the other in a neutral
port, or within three miles of the shore. But when
the <i>Alabama</i> steamed out to a distance of perhaps
eight miles, she was assailed by the <i>Kearsarge</i>, and a
fierce battle ensued. The two ships were substantially
the same in size, but the <i>Kearsarge</i> was a chain
protected vessel, stronger in every way than her Confederate
adversary, and on that Sunday morning of
June nineteenth, 1864, she made short work of the
Confederate cruiser. The <i>Alabama</i> was quickly
riddled, and went down stern foremost. Many of
her crew went down with her and perished in the sea.
The remainder of them were picked up by a British
yacht and carried in safety to England.</p>

<p>There were other Confederate cruisers like unto the
<i>Alabama</i>, including the <i>Shenandoah</i>, the <i>Florida</i>, the
<i>Tallahassee</i>, the <i>Tacony</i>, and the <i>Georgia</i>. These
ships largely aided in that destruction of American
commerce in which the <i>Alabama</i> had taken the lead.
But none of them had so picturesque a career as was
that of the <i>Alabama</i>, while the careers of all of them
are fitly represented by that of Admiral Semmes's
ship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
The destructive activities of these ships were afterwards
made the subject of an international arbitration,
and Great Britain was condemned to pay to the
United States an indemnity of $15,500,000 for her
neglect of international comity in permitting them to
sail from her ports.</p></div>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Sherman's Campaign against Atlanta</span></span></h2>

<p>The plan by which General Grant hoped to crush
the Confederacy during the summer of 1864 and to
make an end of the resisting power of its armies has
been set forth already. In that plan, as the reader
will remember, an operation second in importance
only to Grant's own campaign in Virginia was Sherman's
southward march from Chattanooga, which was
intended to defeat Johnston, seize upon Atlanta, and
push forward thence through the heart of the Confederacy,
either to Mobile or to Savannah, in either
case cutting the Confederacy in two and leaving Lee
with no substantial country behind him. Sherman
had already in the spring swept through the country
from Vicksburg to Chattanooga, paralyzing Confederate
resistance there, breaking up all the railroad
communications, and opening a wide path on the east
of the Mississippi river for any military operations
that the Federal Government might decide to institute
in that quarter of the country. Then Grant in
pursuance of his policy of putting his strongest lieutenants
into the most important commands under
himself, had ordered Sherman to take control of all
the forces in the West, subject to no dictation whatsoever,
except such as Grant himself might find occasion
to exercise. And in giving Sherman his orders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
Grant steadfastly bore in mind his conviction that
Sherman was a general too capable and too energetic
to need minute instruction or anything more than
general orders. To Sherman he assigned a command
and a duty. He left it to Sherman's own judgment
so to handle the command as to execute the duty, and
accomplish the purpose intended.</p>

<p>Many months earlier Grant had left affairs undirected
in a part of the smaller area which he then
controlled upon the avowed ground that "Sherman
was there." Upon the same principle and in the same
abounding confidence in his lieutenant, he thought it
sufficient in 1864 to tell Sherman in a general way
what he wanted him to do in aid of the general purposes
of the campaign, and to leave him to do it in
his own way. In scarcely any other act of his life did
Grant better illustrate the breadth and strength of
his own capacity than he did in thus appreciating and
trusting Sherman, and in treating Meade in like manner
in Virginia so far as his own presence with
Meade's army permitted.</p>

<p>Sherman's problem was difficult of execution, but
perfectly simple in its terms. It was his duty to assail
Johnston, destroy him if possible, seize upon Atlanta,
the great railroad center of the South, and push a
column thence to the sea. For the accomplishment
of this purpose Sherman had the Army of the Cumberland,
commanded by General George H. Thomas,
the Army of the Tennessee, commanded by General
James B. McPherson, and the Army of the Ohio,
commanded by General John M. Schofield. His total
fighting force was about 100,000 men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
Opposed to him was Johnston, who lay at Dalton,
Georgia, with about 43,000 men.</p>

<p>Sherman had hope of reinforcements sufficient at
least to make good his losses on the march which he
was about to undertake, while Johnston perfectly
knew that he could hope for no reinforcement at all.
Sherman had lines of communication over which he
could bring to his army 130 carloads of provisions
each day. Johnston's men sometimes had scanty rations,
and sometimes none at all. He had no secure
source of supply in any quarter, as was usually the
case with Confederate armies at this period of the
war. Lee's army had received a ration of three quarters
of a pound of uncooked flour to each man at
Spottsylvania just before the movement from that
point, and it was three days later&mdash;three days of hard
fighting and hard marching&mdash;before the majority of
them received any other rations whatsoever. Johnston's
army was similarly starved during the campaign
of Atlanta.</p>

<p>On the fifth of May, 1864, at precisely the same
time when Grant moved into the Wilderness, Sherman
set out on his march to Atlanta. With the true
instinct of a fighting commander, he had stripped
himself and his army of all encumbering baggage and
other superfluities. He had no tent, even for himself.
And he boasted in after years that he changed his
underclothes only once between Chattanooga and
Atlanta. He required all his officers, high and low,
except General Thomas, whose health was impaired,
to follow his own example of unencumbered movement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
The distance from Chattanooga to Atlanta, as the
crow flies, is almost exactly a hundred miles. Johnston's
position at Dalton was about fifteen miles
southeast of Chattanooga. The country is a hilly and
broken one, traversed by many streams which afford
good defensive positions to a retiring army, as do
also the various gaps among the hills which must be
crossed by an army advancing offensively. Johnston
was strongly fortified at Dalton and Sherman, not
venturing to assail him in his works there, sent McPherson
to make a détour, and strike the Confederate
lines of communication at Resaca, ten miles or so
farther south.</p>

<p>There McPherson found Johnston's men behind
earthworks, and wisely or unwisely shrank from attacking
them in their defenses. If he could have
carried the works at Resaca Johnston's position would
have been one of extremest danger from which he
could escape only by fighting on all sides at once, and
forcing his way through opposing lines, strongly
posted and well fortified. But in McPherson's judgment
an attack at that point with such force as he had
with him was unadvisable. He therefore refrained
from attack, and fell back to a secure position in the
hills to await the approach of reinforcements. Sherman
promptly moved to McPherson's position, only
to find that Johnston had also retired from Dalton to
Resaca, and had concentrated his entire army there
in a strong defensive position.</p>

<p>Even with all his army present Sherman, himself,
hesitated to attack Johnston in his works&mdash;a fact
which seems a sufficient answer to that criticism of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
McPherson which has been freely exploited in writings
concerning this campaign.</p>

<p>Sherman, however, had so greatly the advantage of
Johnston in numbers that he could afford to send
large detachments against the Confederate general's
communications, while still holding a threatening
position of his own in front. This he did with consummate
skill, forcing Johnston with his small army
to retreat southward following the railroad, and destroying
as he went.</p>

<p>Johnston left Resaca on the night of the fifteenth
of May, and on the nineteenth took position at Cassville,
where he seemed to offer battle to his enemy.
But after some sharp skirmishing the Confederate
general retreated again during the night of the twentieth
to a point south of the Etowah river and to
Alatoona.</p>

<p>After a few days of rest and reprovisioning, Sherman
moved again, not directly against his antagonist,
but by the flank, so as to threaten Marietta and
Atlanta itself, which lies only a few miles south of
Marietta. By this movement Sherman hoped to
force Johnston to abandon his strong position at Alatoona
Pass, where he securely held the railroad over
which Sherman had need to bring his supplies in any
further advance that he might make southward.</p>

<p>Promptly recognizing the purpose of this movement,
Johnston marched westward to assail his enemy
in flank. The two armies met at New Hope Church,
a point a few miles west of Marietta, and a few miles
northwest of Atlanta. Here for six days there was
continuous and very bloody fighting, both armies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
doing their work in a fashion that rivaled even that
of the contending forces in Virginia.</p>

<p>By virtue of his superior numbers, Sherman was
able to make strong detachments to assail the communications
and the flanks of Johnston's army, and
thus to compel him to fall back again to a strong defensive
position on the railroad above Marietta, on
Kenesaw, Lost and Pine Mountains.</p>

<p>Against this position Sherman advanced with caution,
strongly entrenching himself in its front. There
the fighting was continuous and costly of human life
on both sides. There it was that General Leonidas
Polk, Protestant Episcopal Bishop of Louisiana,
who had been educated at West Point for the military
service, but who had afterwards risen to the highest
place of honor in his church as a Bishop, and had
at the outbreak of the war entered the Confederate
service in which he had risen to the rank of major
general, was instantly killed by a cannon shot which
Sherman himself had directed to be fired into a group
of Confederate officers of whom he caught sight on a
hill. This was on June 14.</p>

<p>If he had had anything like Sherman's force with
which to contest Sherman's advance, Johnston's position
at this time would have been one of peculiar
strength and opportunity. But his line was ten miles
long, and the ground was so broken that the reinforcement
of one part of it by another was peculiarly
difficult, while, on the other hand, Sherman's assailing
position was geographically such that he might
concentrate forces at will and without observation
against any point in Johnston's line which he might
select for assault.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
Without further following the details of this
struggle it is enough to say that day by day Johnston
slowly retired toward Atlanta, obstinately fighting at
every point and baffling all the efforts of his brilliant
assailant to break through his lines, or to take him by
surprise in the rear of either of his flanks.</p>

<p>On the morning of the twenty-seventh of June
Sherman determined to end this struggle by a tremendous
assault upon his enemy's entrenchments.
At two points a mile apart he hurled his columns
against them with all the fury that it was possible to
infuse into the minds and the conduct of veteran soldiers.
At the same time he ordered all other troops
on all other parts of the line to maintain an incessant
fire by way of preventing the removal of troops from
the unassailed parts of Johnston's lines, for the reinforcement
of those defending the points of special
attack.</p>

<p>It was Sherman's hope to break through Johnston's
lines, cut his army in twain, hold one half of it
in position by stubborn fighting and crush the other
half by a desperate rush. This plan was baffled only
by the desperate courage and splendid obstinacy of
the fighting on the Confederate side. The Federal
columns advanced to the charge with all the determination
that is possible even to the best of veteran troops.
The Confederates resisted with a like determination,
mowing down their adversaries by a withering fire
from behind the breastworks, and so far depleting
their strength as to render it impossible for them to
force their way over or through the resisting lines.
A very few of Sherman's men succeeded in reaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
the Confederate works, and these were promptly shot
down or made prisoners. Sherman's loss in this attempt
was more than 2,500 men, while the Confederate
loss was less than one third as great.</p>

<p>Thus defeated in his attempt to push his way to
Atlanta, while holding on to his communications in
rear, Sherman now determined upon a desperate move
which violated all the traditions of war and all the
teachings of the books on strategy, but which both
Lee and Grant had boldly adopted and with success,
on other and most notable occasions. Loading his
wagons with ten days' supplies of food and ammunition
he decided to abandon his communications altogether,
move independently of them, and trust to the
fortunes of war for a success which might justify the
daring of his endeavor. He had tried and failed to
force Johnston back to Atlanta. He now determined
to maneuver him into such retreat and in the course
of his maneuvering boldly to take the risk of the
destruction or the capture of his own army.</p>

<p>His plan was to swing his entire army&mdash;foot loose
from its communications&mdash;around Johnston's flank,
and to strike the railroad in the Confederate general's
rear, between Marietta and Atlanta. If he could succeed
in doing this, he would easily compel Johnston
to make a hasty retreat upon the defenses of Atlanta.
But should he fail in doing it he would have on his
hands an army in the field, destitute alike of provisions
and ammunition so soon at least, as the supplies
it carried with it should be consumed. In that event
he must surrender to a foe vastly inferior to himself
in numbers, for no army can long live without food<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
and no army can fight after its ammunition is expended.</p>

<p>Thus Sherman undertook to accomplish certain
great military operations within ten days' time, with
the certainty present to his mind that should he
fail he must fail disastrously, sacrifice all the achievement
which he had set out to gain, and possibly even
surrender an army that outnumbered its adversary
far more than two to one.</p>

<p>Following the same plan which Grant was following
in Virginia but by reverse process, Sherman on
the night of July second made a movement by his
right flank southward, withdrawing first the troops
on his left, and passing them to the right, in rear of
troops still holding the lines.</p>

<p>Johnston was quick to penetrate Sherman's purpose,
and by way of defeating it he promptly abandoned
his position, and fell back to the Chattahoochee
river, which closely flanks Atlanta on the northwest.
Sherman had hoped that Johnston would attempt the
immediate crossing of that stream, and he therefore
hurried forward his strongest divisions, in the hope
of catching his enemy in the act, and assailing him
at a disadvantage. But Johnston was too wily for
that. He had prepared for himself in advance a line
of fortifications along the Chattahoochee, which
Sherman has described as one of the strongest pieces
of field fortifications he ever saw.</p>

<p>Here Johnston briefly paused while Sherman prepared
to turn his position by crossing the river both
above and below. The works, however, gave Johnston
the opportunity he desired to make his crossing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
unmolested, and with his little handful of men after
his brilliant and sturdily fighting retreat, before an
army heavily outnumbering his own Johnston retired
to the defenses of Atlanta.</p>

<p>Then on the seventeenth of July came a change of
commanders on the Confederate side which did more
than anything else that happened or could have happened
during the campaign, to help forward Sherman's
success. Angrily and with insulting comment,
the Confederate authorities removed Johnston from
command and ordered him to turn over his authority
to General John B. Hood.</p>

<p>In a subordinate position Hood had demonstrated
a vigorous fighting capacity. He had not before
commanded an army, and in the opinion of those
who had directed his operations, he was a man peculiarly
unfit to command an army. General Longstreet
once said of him, "Hood is one of the best
division commanders I ever knew. He would fight
anybody anywhere, at any time. But he has no more
discretion than any pugnacious schoolboy might be
expected to manifest."</p>

<p>Hood's proceedings at and after Atlanta certainly
justified this judgment of a great general who had
had full opportunity to observe his conduct and estimate
his capacities. For surely at no point in the war
was a situation more blunderingly or more bravely
handled than was that at Atlanta under Hood. If
that general had had any discretion at all he must
have seen that it was the one function of his army
to delay, embarrass and prevent Sherman's march
through Georgia to the sea. Yet no sooner was that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
march undertaken than Hood abandoned all effort to
check it, left Sherman free to do as he might, and
himself marched northward upon a wild-goose chase
of campaigning in pursuit of the pot of gold at the
farther end of the rainbow. With all that we shall
deal hereafter.</p>

<p>Hood's reckless impetuosity promptly manifested
itself. Abandoning all of Johnston's precautions,
and quitting his defenses, Hood hurled column after
column upon the enemy on the twentieth of July and
succeeding days, only to have them broken to pieces
in a mad endeavor to accomplish the impossible. He
inflicted heavy losses upon Sherman's army, to be
sure, but his madness entailed upon his own force
losses which it could far less well afford. There is no
doubt whatever that his impetuosity, which some
critics have characterized as foolhardiness, greatly
aided Sherman in his purpose of capturing Atlanta.</p>

<p>Beaten in these insane ventures Hood was slowly
forced back upon the inner defenses of the town, but
he had not yet learned his lesson. As late as the
twenty-second of the month he again moved out of
his fortifications and assailed Sherman with a vigor
which would have been praiseworthy had he possessed
a force adequate to his undertaking. Seven times he
pushed his men forward to the assault, and seven
times he was bloodily repulsed. It was gallant fighting
that he did, but fighting ill directed and foolishly
undertaken. To paraphrase the familiar quotation,
it was magnificent, but it was not war. So far as the
facts are ascertainable, it appears that Hood's losses
greatly exceeded those which he inflicted upon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
enemy, a very serious circumstance in view of the
fact of his greatly inferior numbers.</p>

<p>On the twenty-seventh of July Sherman again
moved by his right flank in the attempt to cut the railroad
lines south of Atlanta. On the twenty-eighth
Hood assailed him violently, and a severe action occurred
involving heavy losses on both sides. Thus
far in the campaign, according to the official reports,
the Confederates had lost 8,841 men, and the Federals
9,917.</p>

<p>The campaign had been accompanied by various
and extensive cavalry raids, chiefly on the part of the
Federal troops. On one of these raids the Federal
General Stoneman was captured with 700 of his men,
while General McCook, who was to have met and coöoperated
with him, lost the greater part of his force
as prisoners.</p>

<p>Continuing his southward movements by the right
flank Sherman at last succeeded in placing his army
south of Atlanta, where a deal of hard fighting occurred.</p>

<p>The position thus taken up by the Federals rendered
it imperative that Hood should either assail
and crush his foe or make such escape as he could
from Atlanta. His efforts to crush his foe had failed
too conspicuously for even so venturesome a commander
to renew them, and accordingly on the night
of September first Hood destroyed all that he could
of government property, and withdrew to a strong
position eastward of the town. Sherman immediately
occupied Atlanta, and quickly made an impregnable
fortress of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
His army now lay fortified almost in the center of
what remained of the Confederacy. A pause for
reorganization, recuperation and the bringing in of
supplies was all that remained to him before he should
undertake that march to the sea by which Grant had
ordered him again to cut the Confederacy in twain.
He expected to make that march in daily and hourly
conflict with Hood's forces. But as we shall see hereafter,
when the story of that matter is told, he made
the march in fact, with no opposition at all, beyond
that of some handfuls of cavalry, for the reason that
Hood, after the surrender of Atlanta, had gone rainbow
chasing northward into Tennessee.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_L" id="CHAPTER_L">CHAPTER L</a><br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Bay Fight at Mobile</span></span></h2>

<p>In the meanwhile another important blow had been
struck in pursuance of Grant's comprehensive plan
of destroying the Confederate capacity of resistance.</p>

<p>The reader will doubtless remember that when
Farragut captured New Orleans in April, 1862, he
desired at once to move against Mobile in the hope
and confident expectation of capturing and closing
all those Confederate ports upon which, as blockade
running centers, the Southerners relied for the export
of their cotton, and the import of arms, ammunition
and clothing. From this purpose Farragut
was diverted by the peremptory orders of civilians in
the navy department at Washington, and it was not
until more than two years later that he was permitted
to act upon a plan which common sense had dictated
from the beginning. In the meanwhile the Confederates,
with that energy and ceaseless determination
which characterized all their activities, had been daily
and hourly rendering the capture of their ports more
and more difficult. At Mobile they had strengthened
the fortifications and mounted destructively heavy
guns in their casemates and upon their parapets.
They had strewn the harbor thick with torpedoes of
every kind then known to the military science of destruction.
When at last in August, 1864, Farragut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
was permitted to undertake that enterprise against
Mobile which would have been easy and nearly bloodless,
if he had been allowed to undertake it two years
and three months earlier, he had before him one of
the most difficult tasks that was set for any naval
commander in this war to accomplish.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of August fifth, Farragut
put his fleet in motion to enter Mobile bay. The entrance
is a narrow one and was obstructed by every
device that engineering ingenuity could place in the
pathway of an invading fleet. The only passageway
into the harbor lay between Fort Morgan on Mobile
Point, and Fort Gaines on Dauphin Island, three
miles away. Two miles of this narrow passageway
had been completely obstructed by the driving of
innumerable piles into the sands, thus forming a
fence through which the stoutest ship could not force
its way. From the end of this pile fence eastward
toward Fort Morgan there extended a quadruple
line of destructive torpedoes. The only open way
into the harbor was a narrow passage left for the use
of blockade runners, directly under the guns of Fort
Morgan.</p>

<p>Inside the bay there was a Confederate fleet of
considerable strength, including one ironclad ram, and
many heavily armed wooden gunboats. The bay was
also thickly strewn with mines and torpedoes, the
exact location of which was known of course to the
Confederate officers, but entirely unknown to Farragut
and his captains.</p>

<p>On the fourth of August a strong land force under
General Gordon Granger succeeded in making a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
landing on Dauphin Island. This gave to Farragut
the support he had desired from the land side. His
time had at last come, and with four ironclad monitors,
seven wooden vessels, all heavily armed, and a
fleet of gunboats he advanced toward the mouth of
the bay, a little after daylight on the morning of
August 5, 1864.</p>

<p>During almost half an hour before Farragut's
ships were in a position from which they could render
their own fire effective, the fire from the Confederate
forts and still more from the Confederate fleet that
lay just inside the entrance line, played havoc with
the wooden ships of Farragut's squadron. His flagship,
the <i>Hartford</i>, had her mainmast shot away and
many of her crew destroyed. Still Farragut pushed
onward without a moment's hesitation at any point
until he brought his ships into a position from which
they could effectively return the Confederate fire.
The heavier metal of his guns quickly and disastrously
told upon the Confederate defenses. But
these continued to belch out destruction in spite of
any crippling that had been done to them, and for a
time the fleet suffered terribly.</p>

<p>In order that he might see everything that occurred
and direct the conflict with full knowledge of all its
details, Farragut mounted to the rigging of his flagship,
and a quartermaster lashed him to the spars in
order that he might not fall to the deck, in the event
of his receiving a wound.</p>

<p>One of Farragut's monitors, the <i>Tecumseh</i>, was
quickly destroyed in an attempt to pass over the line
of torpedoes in order to engage the Confederate ram,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
<i>Tennessee</i>, at close quarters. The <i>Monitor</i> encountered
one of the torpedoes, and its explosion sent
her to the bottom so suddenly that her commander
and most of her crew perished with her.</p>

<p>The <i>Brooklyn</i> had been set to lead the advance with
Farragut's flagship following immediately in her
wake. The <i>Brooklyn</i> was provided with an apparatus
for removing torpedoes in advance of her,
but the apparatus was by no means a perfect one,
and when the commander of that ship discovered the
presence of torpedoes almost immediately under his
bows, he stopped his vessel and began to back her.
The whole fleet was now under a terrific fire, and the
maintenance of its order was of the most vital importance.
Farragut saw in a moment that the backing
of the <i>Brooklyn</i> must result not only in halting
the entire line under a destructive fire, but in throwing
it into hopeless confusion. It was then that he
gave his celebrated order, "Go on, damn the torpedo!"
But as the <i>Brooklyn</i> still hesitated, Farragut
immediately pushed the <i>Hartford</i> past that vessel,
and himself took the lead of the line with his flagship,
"damning the torpedoes."</p>

<p>Having crippled the forts and forced his way past
the entrance into the harbor, Farragut ordered all his
gunboats which had been lashed to the wooden vessels
to cut loose, and assail the enemy's fleet. This they
did with vigor and promptitude, capturing or destroying
nearly all of the Confederate vessels.</p>

<p>There still remained, however, the Confederate
ram, <i>Tennessee</i>, a powerful ironclad ship, commanded
by a gallant captain, and manned by a desperately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
determined crew. Seeing what had happened, the
commander of the <i>Tennessee</i> instantly tripped his
anchors, and steamed at full speed into the midst of
the Federal fleet, firing as he went, and with the great
steel nose of his ship ramming every vessel that came
in his way. Farragut's fleet in the meanwhile poured
all the fire possible upon the ironclad monster to
no effect, and many of them stove in their bows in
a futile effort to sink her by collision. Then the
monitors assailed her and so far crippled her, after a
brief struggle, that she surrendered.</p>

<p>The story of this great battle at the mouth of
Mobile Bay has been splendidly told in verse by
Henry Howard Brownell in his poem entitled, "The
Bay Fight." Mr. Brownell had written a poem
called "The River Fight" in celebration of Farragut's
struggle for the defenses of New Orleans two
years before. Farragut had written to the poet,
expressing his appreciation of his tribute, and at
Brownell's request that he might accompany the
great sea fighter in his next battle, Farragut had
taken him with him on the <i>Hartford</i> as a witness to
the struggle at the mouth of Mobile Bay.</p>

<p>The battle there had been a desperate one, costly in
life and in ships, but it had accomplished its purpose.
Farragut had passed the forts after crippling them
so badly that they surrendered a few days later. He
had destroyed the Confederate fleet and was now
completely master of the entrance to a harbor which
he had permanently sealed against the world. By
reason of shoal water in the bay, he found it impossible
to steam up to the city and take possession of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
But at any rate he had destroyed it for all useful purposes
as a Confederate port. Its capture from the
land side was now certain, whenever any one of the
Federal generals in the field should see fit to move
against it in adequate force. In the meanwhile its
nominal defense served henceforth only to occupy
troops whose presence was badly needed by Lee in
his great contest with Grant in Virginia.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Mine Explosion at Petersburg</span></span></h2>

<p>General Grant was a man of skill and genius in the
game of war. But until the summer of 1864 he had
never played that game against another great master
of it. He had baffled and beaten Albert Sydney
Johnston, whose reputation as a commander of great
skill rests rather upon the anticipation of his comrades
in the old army at the outbreak of the war, than
upon any demonstration of such skill made by himself.
Grant had held his own and more against
Beauregard in the tremendous second day's struggle
at Shiloh. He had overcome great natural obstacles
in his effort to take Vicksburg and he had received
there the surrender of Pemberton,&mdash;a general who
had never before commanded an army in the field, or
in any other way manifested a capacity for command.
Grant had also met Bragg at Chattanooga and beaten
him. But none of these antagonists had been comparable
with Lee as a great master of strategy and
command.</p>

<p>When Grant found himself defeated at Cold Harbor,
as he has himself described his situation, he had
been baffled in both the purposes with which he had
undertaken his campaign. He had not crushed Lee's
army, nor had he succeeded in cutting it off from its
base in the fortifications of Richmond. He had said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
at Spottsylvania that he would "fight it out on this
line if it takes all summer." The summer was still
young when he found himself at Cold Harbor unable
to do further fighting upon that line. He had
crippled his enemy, it is true, but he had lost more than
three men to that enemy's one, and that enemy still
lay between him and Richmond in a mood of resoluteness
and defiance. There was no way open to him by
which, with any show of sanity, to assail Lee further
in the field. It was then that he decided upon a campaign
on other lines than those which he had chosen
at the beginning of the summer.</p>

<p>He hoped by his movement upon Petersburg to
take Lee at last by surprise, to cut his communications,
and compel his precipitate retreat from the
Confederate capital. Here again he was baffled of
his purpose. There remained to him only the resource
of dogged determination. He called for reinforcements
in order that his army might always outnumber
that of his adversary by two or three to one, and thus
equipped with superior force, he determined, by continually
extending his lines to the south and west, to
draw Lee's slender line of defense into the condition
of an attenuated thread.</p>

<p>Let us make this military situation clear to the
minds of unmilitary readers. Grant lay east of
Richmond and Petersburg, with a secure base of supplies
at City Point on the James river, just in his
rear. That base was perfectly protected by a great
war fleet which lay in the river and held it. It was
easily accessible from the North by transports of
every kind, bringing troops or supplies of food or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
ammunition. Grant's rear was as secure and as well
furnished as if it had rested upon New York harbor.</p>

<p>He so disposed his men as to threaten Richmond
and Petersburg over a space of about thirty miles.
His battalions and his guns besieged the two cities all
the way from a position north of Richmond, across
James river and the Appomattox, to a point south and
west of Petersburg. Good roads and a railroad in
his rear lay beyond the possible sight of his enemy,
and by the use of these he could concentrate any
force he pleased at any point he might select upon
Lee's attenuated lines,&mdash;all without Lee's knowledge,
and beyond the possibility of his discovery.</p>

<p>From the beginning of these siege operations to the
end General Grant's plan was not that which is here
suggested, but another and slower one. It was his
plan to continue the extension of his lines southward
and westward toward the Weldon railroad, thus compelling
his adversary to stretch out his lines and
weaken his defenses at every point, and at the same
time threatening his communications with the south.
This cautious policy is explained and perhaps justified
by the fact that in the preliminary operations
against Petersburg, in which General Grant was
baffled of his purpose to take that town with a rush,
the Federals had lost no less than 10,000 men in a
stubborn fight with Lee's small head of column. To
assail Lee and such an army as that which Lee commanded
behind entrenchments was a task so difficult
and so perilous that it might well give pause to the
most daring and most obstinate of generals.</p>

<p>No sooner was position taken up in front of Petersburg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
than Grant began his bold operations against
the Weldon railroad leading thence southward. On
the twenty-first and twenty-second of June Grant
and Meade sent heavy forces southward and hurled
them upon the Confederate defenses of that railroad.
These forces were promptly met by the Confederates
and disastrously defeated with a loss of 1,700 prisoners
and four guns captured.</p>

<p>The failure of this enterprise ended operations in
that quarter with such purpose for several weeks to
come. Another plan was formed by which to break
Confederate resistance. Immediately in front of
Petersburg the two opposing lines of fortifications
lay at one point within less than fifty yards of each
other. Each line was strongly built and each was
protected at every point by traverses,&mdash;earthworks
built at right angles to the main works, as a protection
against an enfilade or cross fire. So close were the
works together, and so incessant was the fire that it
became at last impossible for men on either side to
show their heads above the works in order to discharge
their guns. On either side port holes were made by
the placing of sand bags on top of the parapets, in
such fashion as to leave holes through which the men
might fire their guns. Even these port holes were
unavailable for use if by any chance the enemy looking
toward them through a port hole on the other side
could see the sky beyond. The moment a man undertook
to shoot through the port hole his head, obscuring
the light, revealed his presence there to some sharpshooter
on the other side who was standing ready with
gun aimed and "bead drawn" waiting to fire into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
hole the instant the sky beyond should be obscured
by human presence. So ceaseless was the fire at this
point that repeated experiments showed that any twig
thrust above the crest of the parapet would be instantly
cut in two by one of the multitudinous bullets
which were flowing in a continuous stream from one
side to the other.</p>

<p>The space between the works was so perfectly and
completely commanded by Confederate artillery that
no general in his senses would have thought of attempting
to cross it, even with the most heroic of
veterans. But just in rear of the Federal lines there
was a cavernous hollow between the hills, where anything
might be done without the possibility of Confederate
discovery. A regiment composed mainly of
Pennsylvania coal miners was brought to that point,
and instructed to push a mining shaft under the hill
in order to plant a great mine immediately beneath
the Confederate works.</p>

<p>The tunnel began in the ravine in rear of the
Federal works, and extended thence 500 feet. This
brought it immediately under an important redan in
the Confederate lines. There a cross gallery eighty
feet long was dug, and packed full of gunpowder,&mdash;8,000
pounds in all.</p>

<p>The plan was to surprise the Confederates and
break their lines by the explosion of this tremendous
mine on the morning of the thirtieth of July. It was
intended to take advantage of the confusion thus
created, and push a strong column through the gap
made in the works, thus cutting Lee's army in two,
and compelling it to retreat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
The affair was badly managed from beginning to
end, and resulted in a disaster which amounted almost
to a crime. For the execution of such an enterprise
as this, General Meade ought to have selected his most
daring and determined subordinate to lead the assailing
force. Instead of that he permitted the selection
to be made by some species of lot drawing, and
the choice fell upon General James H. Ledlie, who
proved himself peculiarly unfit for the conduct of an
enterprise that required so much of heroic daring.
General Grant in his "Memoirs" says of this officer
that, "Ledlie, besides being otherwise inefficient,
proved also to possess a disqualification less common
among soldiers." He did, indeed, order his men to
advance into the breach made by the explosion which
occurred at about daylight, but he did not lead them.
He remained instead, during all that terrible day,
securely ensconced in the ravine that lay in rear of
the Federal line.</p>

<p>The explosion completely destroyed a Confederate
fort and its garrison, leaving a vast crater thirty feet
deep and two hundred feet long into which Ledlie's
men were sent like sheep to the slaughter. Having
reached the crater they stopped there instead of pushing
on as had been intended and running over the
weak second line of Confederate defense. Thus the
whole purpose of the enterprise was completely defeated
at the outset for lack of capable leadership.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that at that period of the
war Lee's army was so far battle seasoned that any
form of panic was to it completely impossible. Even
when it saw the most important part of its line blown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
up, and thousands of Federal troops rushing into the
crater, the Army of Northern Virginia remained
steadfast and unshaken. Hurried orders were given,
and promptly obeyed. Within ten minutes after Ledlie's
column came to a halt in the crater it was forever
too late for them to gain the advantage intended by
rushing through that slender second line which held
the Jerusalem plank road, and which alone stood then
between the Federal army and Petersburg. Under
Lee's command, the Army of Northern Virginia had
become as perfect a piece of military mechanism as
ever existed, and under Lee's command, for both Lee
and Beauregard were promptly present at the post
of danger, the men of that army were quickly shifted
into positions against which an advance of their enemy
would have been nothing less than wholesale suicide.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Ledlie's men in the crater were
as helpless to retire as they were to advance. They
were practically leaderless and the space in rear of
them was already commanded by Confederate artillery
which could sweep it with canister from end to
end. To this commanding force of artillery Lee
promptly added thirty-five other guns, placing each
in a position from which it could hurl its missiles from
one end to the other of the doomed space.</p>

<p>It was not until after midday that these preparations
and others of a like kind were completed. But
in the meanwhile detachments from Lamkin's battery
of mortars were pushed up and placed behind traverses
within sixty yards of that cavernous hole in
which thousands of Federal soldiers were lying helpless
for lack of a leader fit to command them. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
mortars continued ceaselessly throughout the morning
to hurl twenty-four-pound shells into the hole at
the rate of twenty a minute. This fire was murderous
in an extreme degree, but there was no escape from
it. The men subjected to it had no choice but to sit
still and await the end. They could neither advance
nor retreat with any hope of escape in either direction.</p>

<p>Finally a little after midday, and after he had completed
his preparations and the placing of his guns,
Lee ordered Mahone, with a heavy infantry force, to
charge across the field to the very edge of the crater,
and pour into it a fire so destructive that its further
tenancy should be rendered impossible. The more
desperate of the Federal troops in the hole risked
flight toward their own lines, fifty yards away. Not
many of them succeeded in getting there. The rest
surrendered, and the Confederates occupied the
crater.</p>

<p>The narrow space between the two lines was literally
piled high with dead Federal soldiers, lying on
top of each other, sometimes three deep, and in some
places five. A day later there was a suspension of
hostilities for a few hours, and the dead were dragged
away and buried.</p>

<p>This badly managed affair well nigh rivaled the
blunder at Cold Harbor in its costliness to the Army
of the Potomac. Grant's loss was more than 4,000
men,&mdash;Lee's less than 1,000.</p>

<p>The whole enterprise was of doubtful military propriety.
Yet if it had been conducted with an energy
and capability equal to that which had been brought
to bear upon other fields it might have promised the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
early and complete destruction of Lee's defenses. If
there had been, in command of the troops set apart
for the assault, such a man as Sheridan, for example,
or Hooker, or Hancock, the chance was an even one
or better that the force hurled suddenly upon Lee's
broken line could have made its way into Petersburg
by impetuous advance. It must be accounted one of
General Meade's rare failures in judgment, that he
did not place the assailing force under some such commander
upon whom he could depend to give wise
personal direction and leadership to the desperate
fighting needed on such an occasion.</p>

<p>In its outcome, this enterprise which had been
planned for the destruction of Lee and his army, resulted
rather in their strengthening. Having recaptured
the crater they promptly threw up a line of
works along that side of it which lay nearest to their
enemy, thus in fact, shortening the distance between
the two lines, without in any way weakening their
position.</p>

<p>An unfortunate circumstance connected with this
affair was the fact that General Burnside, who had
general command in that part of the field, made a
desperate endeavor&mdash;which came a few minutes too
late&mdash;to force the Confederate second line by an advance
of the negro troops under his command. These
pushed themselves as far forward up the hill as they
could go and were there hurled back and driven into
the great pit. In the event many of them were captured.
The Confederates refused to recognize these
black men as soldiers or to treat them as prisoners of
war. It was a time, indeed, when the Southern soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
were in a state of peculiar exasperation and revengefulness
against negroes in arms. During a
recent raid certain negro troops had committed unforgiveable
outrages upon women, and in consequence
the mood of mind of the Army of Northern Virginia
was such that a negro soldier in arms had better have
fallen into hell than into their hands. General Lee
and his subordinates did what they could to compel a
merciful treatment for the negro troops who were
captured in the crater. It was all to no purpose.
Every effort made to send these men to the rear as
prisoners under charge of details ended in a report
from the commander of the detail that the negroes
had "escaped." Their escape was of such kind that
burial parties had to be sent into the covered ways
leading to Petersburg to clear them of the negro
corpses there.</p>

<p>General Grant has said of this mine enterprise:
"The effort was a stupendous failure. It cost us
about 4,000 men, mostly however, captured; and all
due to inefficiency on the part of the corps commander
(Burnside) and the incompetency of the division
commander (Ledlie) who were sent to lead the
assault."</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Early's Invasion of Pennsylvania</span></span></h2>

<p>It will be remembered that General Grant set out
upon his Virginia campaign of 1864 with the definite
and avowed purpose of crushing and destroying Lee
in the field. The completeness of his failure to accomplish
this purpose was made manifest in July,
when Lee, confronting the consolidated armies of the
Potomac and the James, nevertheless felt himself
strong enough to detach from his own force a vigorous
body of troops under Early, with instructions to
sweep Hunter out of the Valley of Virginia and undertake
a third invasion of Maryland, so conducted
as to threaten Baltimore and Washington.</p>

<p>This movement was a peculiarly daring one, but
the strategy of it was brilliant. The detachment of
the troops sent to Early seriously weakened the force
that Lee had under his command for the defense of
the Confederate capital, but he hoped for such results
from Early's movement as should again compel the
Federal Government to weaken or withdraw Grant's
army from the siege of Petersburg. He had twice
before succeeded by such tactics in compelling the
Army of the Potomac to withdraw from Virginia
and stand upon its defense at the North. In both
instances as soon as that army had withdrawn Lee
himself had moved with all his force to the support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
of the invading column. There is little doubt that he
intended to repeat this operation if Early's threat to
Washington should prove effective in compelling
Grant's withdrawal from Virginia. But by this time
volunteering by hundreds of thousands and drafts,
some of which brought as many as half a million men
into the field, had so enormously increased the Federal
numbers that Grant was strongly disposed to
leave the defense of Washington to quite other troops
than those he had with him in his operations at Petersburg.
The disparity of numbers between the two
armies had now become too great to be offset by
brilliant strategy, or by any energy in daring enterprise.</p>

<p>Hunter had so far carried out Grant's plan of
ravaging the Valley of Virginia and moving upon the
Confederate lines of communication at Lynchburg,
as to create in Lee's mind a serious apprehension.
Partly to meet this danger, and partly with a larger
strategic purpose, Lee detached Early, and sent him
down the Valley with about 8,000 men. Slipping into
the upper or southern end of the valley without discovery,
Early plunged forward impetuously, and so
completely broke Hunter's resistance that that general,
instead of retiring before his enemy toward the
Potomac, abandoned the field completely, and took
refuge in West Virginia, thus leaving Early's pathway
to the region beyond the Potomac open and unobstructed.
Early was an officer of extraordinary
vigor and promptitude. He quickly crossed the
Potomac and pushed on to Monocacy near the city of
Frederick. There he was met by a force under General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
Lew Wallace on the ninth of July. Hurling his
army upon Wallace he quickly swept him from the
field. He then pushed forward until, on the eleventh
of July, he came within sight of Washington City
itself, and for a time it was gravely feared there that
he would enter and possess the Federal capital.</p>

<p>Grant had known nothing of Early's detachment
from Lee's army until the news came to him that the
Confederates were marching upon Washington in
threatening force. As has been said before, it was
Grant's conviction that Washington ought to be able
to take care of itself so long as the main body of the
Army of Northern Virginia was kept busy in his own
front at Richmond and Petersburg. Nevertheless, as
soon as news came to him that Early had defeated
Hunter and driven him out of the valley, and that
the Confederates were rapidly advancing upon
Washington, Grant detached a strong force, and hurried
it to the capital city. In the meanwhile the
authorities at Washington seem to have been thrown
into a panic as dangerous as it was senseless. They
did, indeed, take certain measures of defense. They
put arms in the hands of the clerks in the several departments,
and sought with these to make some show
of opposition to the approach of the Confederate
veterans. This was manifestly useless. The time
had long gone by when untrained clerks, however well
armed, could be expected to stand for one moment
against the battle-hardened veterans who had learned
their trade under Lee or Grant in the desperate struggles
in Virginia. It is not an exaggeration but simple
truth to say that at that time a single regiment from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
either the Army of Northern Virginia or the Army
of the Potomac could easily and almost without effort
have swept away a hundred thousand untrained
militiamen, however patriotic they may have been,
and however they may have been inspired with personal
courage. To send a mob of department clerks,
however numerous, against such a force as that which
Early commanded was like sending sheep to a contest
with wolves. It meant the butchery of the poor fellows,
without the smallest hope that their sacrifice of
life could yield anything of advantage to the Federal
cause or could delay the Confederate progress by
more than a few minutes at the most. But Grant had
promptly met the danger by hurrying two corps of
his veterans to Washington city. Fortunately for the
Federal cause, this force got there in time to interpose
itself effectively between Early and the capital.</p>

<p>After burning the city of Chambersburg Early
was compelled to retire, which he did at once without
loss, taking up a strong position in the Valley of Virginia,
where his presence as a continual threat to
Washington city was more effective than his coöperation
with Lee at Petersburg could have been.</p>

<p>Posted in the valley, Early's little force of 8,000
men served to occupy twice or thrice that number of
Grant's troops in the defense of Washington, and in
preparation for repelling an apprehended invasion of
the country north of that city.</p>

<p>This Monocacy campaign, as it is called in history,
involved no great battle, but as a strategic influence
it was an achievement of the utmost importance to
General Lee. Before that campaign was begun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
Hunter's presence in the Valley and his mastery there
served not only to cut off from Lee the rich supplies
which it was his custom to draw from that quarter of
the country, but also to threaten him dangerously in
the rear. If Hunter had been let alone, he must presently
have forced his way to Lynchburg, cutting Lee's
chief line of communication with the south and west,
and opening the way to a junction between his own
force and the forces which were pushing forward by
Grant's order from Tennessee toward that point. By
the detachment of Early with 8,000 men Lee had
succeeded in preventing all this; in driving Hunter
beyond the mountains into West Virginia, where his
force could render no assistance whatever to Grant's
campaign; in clearing the valley of all Federal forces;
and in compelling Grant to keep at Washington a
strong force which he might otherwise have utilized
in his operations at Petersburg.</p>

<p>For several months after the Monocacy campaign
this continued to be the situation. It grew at last so
intolerable to Grant that he sent Sheridan to the Valley
to drive Early out, and possess that fair region.
In the meanwhile the results of Early's brilliant campaign
with a handful of men, and his still more important
success in holding the Valley of Virginia with
that same handful of men, had its influence upon
operations at the principal seat of hostilities.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Operations at Petersburg and Sheridan's Valley Campaign</span></span></h2>

<p>In the mine operation General Grant had been
baffled even more conspicuously than at the Wilderness
or at Spottsylvania or at Cold Harbor. All his
efforts to break through Lee's lines had completely
failed. All his efforts to crush Lee and destroy his
resisting power had come to naught. There remained
to him&mdash;notwithstanding his enormous superiority of
force and of the materials of war&mdash;only the resource
of continuing the regular siege operations already in
progress.</p>

<p>For such operations he was peculiarly well
equipped. He had more men than his adversary had
by three or four to one. He had an unassailable base
of supplies upon the James river to which his vessels
could come without the slightest fear of molestation.
He had unlimited supplies while his adversary hung
all the time upon the verge of starvation. He had a
railroad in his rear over which he could move trains
at will without even the possibility of his adversary's
discovery. He had already by the extension of his
lines compelled Lee to draw his out to the point of
breaking. Grant could, at any moment, concentrate
a hundred thousand men and a hundred guns upon
any point in Lee's line which he might select for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
assault, and that without the smallest possibility of
Lee's discovering his purpose. But instead of
assault, which he had many times attempted with
disastrous results, General Grant wisely determined
to continue his policy of attenuating Lee's lines by
enforced extension. He continued to move his own
troops southward and westward toward and along
the Weldon railroad, thus compelling Lee to stretch
out his lines until the men in his breastworks, instead
of standing elbow to elbow, stood many feet
apart, and held their ground only by virtue of a
desperate determination.</p>

<p>On the thirteenth of August Grant sent Hancock
to assail the defenses of Richmond on the northern
side of the James river. Lee was prompt to meet
him, and the Confederates succeeded in repelling
every attack made throughout a succession of bloody
days. But while these operations were going on north
of the James, Grant availed himself of his superior
numbers by sending Warren on the eighteenth to
seize upon the Weldon railroad south of Petersburg,
and entrench himself in a line crossing that avenue of
Confederate communication. On the nineteenth of
August and again on the twenty-first, Lee desperately
assailed Warren in this position, but without
success. On the twenty-fifth a Confederate force
under General A.&nbsp;P.  Hill was sent forward to recapture
the position. The Confederates made three
desperate assaults, but in each case were beaten back
with terrific loss. Finally, Hill ordered Heth's division
to move forward and carry the works at all
hazards and all costs. That was an order which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
veterans in these two contending armies understood,
and were accustomed to obey. Ordered to carry the
works, Heth did so, capturing three batteries and a
large number of prisoners. Then the Federals, under
General Miles, rallied and made a counter assault,
recapturing a part of the works, but suffering terribly
in the encounter. In this fierce struggle the
Federals lost 2,400 men. The Confederate loss has
never been accurately reported, but in such desperate
fighting as was done on that field, it must have been
severe.</p>

<p>The total result of this struggle was that Grant
held and continued thereafter to hold a part of the
railroad which led south from Petersburg, by way of
Weldon, and upon which Lee was compelled to depend
in a considerable degree for communication and
supplies. But with that vigor and resourcefulness
which had come to mark the operations of the armies
on both sides, Lee promptly opened a wagon route
thirty miles long and well defended, over which as a
bridge to the gap he was able for months afterwards
to carry all supplies and reinforcements that could be
brought to him from the south.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile there was continuous battling all
along the Richmond and Petersburg lines, which covered
a space of more than thirty miles. The sharpshooting
was incessant, the bombardment scarcely
less so. But Grant was not yet ready to make another
determined assault upon Lee's works, or in any
other way to bring on a battle in earnest.</p>

<p>The defeat and driving away of Hunter from the
Valley was a painful miscarriage of the plans with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
which the lieutenant general had hoped to conduct
the campaign. So long as Early should remain in
the Valley it was obvious that continual raids upon
Washington were not only possible but probable, and
that these raids or even the possibility of them must
seriously impair Grant's strength at Petersburg. Accordingly,
Grant decided that his first care now must
be to regain possession of the valley of Virginia, and
to hold that region irresistibly against Confederate
invasion. To accomplish this he sent for General
Sheridan and placed under his command a force of
30,000 men, or nearly four times as many as those
with which Early could oppose him. With a force so
overwhelming, Sheridan was ordered completely to
clear the valley of Confederate troops, to cut off all
supplies that might come from that fertile region for
the support of Lee's army, and permanently to render
that pathway toward the north a no-thoroughfare
to the Confederates.</p>

<p>Grant's purpose looked to a campaign of utter
and complete destruction. In his orders to Sheridan
he said, "In pushing up the Shenandoah Valley, where
it is expected you will have to go first or last, it is
desirable that nothing should be left to invite the
enemy to return. Take all provisions, forage and
stock wanted for the use of your command. Such as
cannot be consumed destroy. It is not desirable that
the buildings should be destroyed&mdash;they should rather
be protected; but the people should be informed that
so long as an army can subsist among them recurrences
of these raids must be expected; and we are
determined to stop them at all hazards."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
Up to this time General Halleck, who was acting
as adjutant general, though no longer in command,
had continued in annoying ways to interfere with
Grant's orders and proceedings. A dispatch from
Mr. Lincoln warned Grant that certain of his orders
would not be carried out unless he, Grant, should personally
see to their execution. This gave Grant his
opportunity, once for all, to teach Halleck the bitter
lesson that it was now the Galena clerk who had the
right to command. Grant went to Washington and
so far asserted himself that Halleck sent him a message
of complete submission, and thereafter executed
the orders of the commanding general, instead of
criticizing them and interfering with them.</p>

<p>Grant's instructions to Sheridan were to put himself
south of the Confederates, and to follow them
to the death wherever they might go. Having 30,000
men with whom to chase 8,000 Sheridan's task in the
execution of this order was not a difficult one.</p>

<p>Early lay at this time just south of the Potomac, a
little way above Harper's Ferry, and was drawing his
supplies from Maryland by cavalry operations in that
quarter. Sheridan promptly pushed southward
toward Winchester and Early retired to that point to
await reinforcements from Lee. Early retreated as
far as Fisher's Hill, east of Winchester, and there
took up a strong position, offering battle to his adversary
while waiting to be reinforced. There Sheridan
attacked Early on the twenty-first of August and was
beaten off by the Confederates with a loss of two or
three hundred men. Sheridan thereupon retired to
Hall Town, destroying as he went "everything eatable."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
Then occurred one of the odd situations of the
war. For three or four weeks, Early with less than
8,000 men was practically besieging Sheridan with
more than 30,000, and in the meantime keeping
Washington in a condition of chronic fright by
threatening raids into Maryland, West Virginia and
Pennsylvania, by breaking up the Baltimore and
Ohio railroad and the Chesapeake and Ohio canal,
and in other ways behaving himself precisely as he
might have done had his force been four times that
of Sheridan's, instead of being, as it was in fact, one
fourth as great.</p>

<p>Why Sheridan with his enormously superior force
did not at this time fall upon Early and crush him
must always be a puzzling question to the historian
and the military critic. Whatever the explanation
may be, the fact is that during all these weeks Sheridan
was standing at bay in the hope that Grant's
operations before Petersburg might compel Lee to
withdraw Early and his small force from the Valley.
So far from driving Early out of that region Sheridan
stood upon the defensive in order that Early
might not drive him out instead.</p>

<p>At last Lee recalled to Petersburg the troops he
had sent to Early's reinforcement, and about the
same time Early divided his forces, sending a large
part of them to Martinsburg, twenty miles or so north
of Winchester. Here was a great opportunity and
Grant promptly ordered Sheridan to take advantage
of it. On the nineteenth of September Sheridan advanced
with all his force upon Winchester, which
place Early was defending east of the town. Promptly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
discovering the purpose of Sheridan's movement,
Early recalled his troops from Martinsburg, and concentrated
all the force he had in front of Winchester.
A fierce and desperate battle ensued in which the
Federal loss was about 5,000 men, and the Confederate
loss about 4,000. In the end the enormous superiority
of numbers on the Federal side prevailed, and
Early was driven into retreat up the Valley. But the
retreat was made in good order, and all the trains were
saved.</p>

<p>Early retired again to Fisher's Hill, where the Valley
is about four miles in width, and there took up a
strong position for resistance. There on the twenty-second
of September Sheridan again assailed him in
overwhelming force, and after a stubborn fight drove
him again into retreat up the Valley, but failed in a
deliberately formed plan for capturing the meager
Confederate force. During the next three or four
days Early continued his retreat until he reached
Port Republic, and the fighting, though irregular,
was continuous.</p>

<p>Grant had hoped that Sheridan would make his
way as far south as Charlottesville, but in that he was
disappointed. Finding it impossible to force his way
further, Sheridan began a retrograde march northward
down the Valley on the fifth of October. He
destroyed as he went everything that might by any
possibility have value to his enemy. In his report he
said, "I have destroyed over 2,000 barns, filled with
wheat, hay and farming implements; over 70 mills
filled with flour and wheat; have driven in front of
the army over 4,000 head of stock, and have killed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
and issued to the troops not less than 3,000 sheep."
After this march was over Sheridan picturesquely
suggested the desolation he had wrought in one of
the fairest of all God's countries by saying that "The
crow that flies over the Valley of Virginia must henceforth
carry his rations with him."</p>

<p>Here we have a suggestion of the barbarity and
brutality and desolation of war! With their barns
burned, their wheat and their corn and their flour destroyed,
and their stock carried off by the enemy, the
farmers of that rich valley were left by the decree of
war to stare starvation in the face, and to suffer an
extreme of poverty more severe even than that which
wastefulness and debauchery bring to men. With
jaunty indifference to human suffering war decrees
starvation to women and children, the ruin of men's
fortunes, the destruction of their means of subsistence,
and their sudden reduction from affluence to
poverty. In this particular case, in order that no Confederate
army might thereafter secure supplies upon
which to subsist in the Valley of Virginia, Sheridan
decreed that all these farmer folk should be completely
deprived of their substance, that their barns
should be burned, their cattle slaughtered, their sheep
driven off, their wheat stacks reduced to ashes, their
smokehouses stripped of the last flitch of bacon that
might be hanging there&mdash;in brief, that these people,
men, women and children, should be deprived of all
food supplies and left to starve in wretchedness for
the sake of accomplishing a military purpose. How
long, oh, Lord, how long will it be before the world
shall advance to that point in civilization in which war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
will be justly regarded as the infamous crime that it
is? How long will it be before civilization shall cease
to be a mere veneer or varnish and become a matter
of substance in human affairs?</p>

<p>As Sheridan retired northward down the Valley,
Early received some meager reinforcements, and
with that energy which characterized all his operations,
he instantly set out in pursuit of his adversary.</p>

<p>Sheridan had taken a position at Cedar Creek, a
little to the north of Strasburg, and there on the night
of the eighteenth, Early, with every precaution of
silence, moved around the Federal left, and at dawn
of the nineteenth fell upon the Federal forces with
all the vigor he could command. The rout of the
Federals was quick and complete. Sheridan was absent
at the time, and on his return he met his army
in full flight. He instantly set cavalry to work
against his own men, in order to stop the insensate
retreat. Thus rallying his men he turned them back,
entrenched them hastily, and repulsed Early's assault.
Later in the day he took the offensive, and succeeded
in breaking the Confederate line, and driving it into
retreat, capturing 34 Confederate guns in the operation.
On the Confederate side 3,100 men fell in this
contest. On the Federal side the loss amounted to
5,764.</p>

<p>The result of these operations was to give Sheridan
complete command of the Valley of the Shenandoah
for the time being, at least, and to wipe that danger
spot off the map.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Presidential Campaign of 1864</span></span></h2>

<p>At this time there was a presidential campaign in
progress at the North. Throughout the war, the
South had the advantage of a practically united people,
while at the North there was division of sentiment,
and a violent difference of opinion as to policy.
At the North there was a political party bitterly opposing
the administration which must carry on the
war, and even opposing the war itself, as unconstitutional
in its inception, blundering in its management
and completely barren of results.</p>

<p>Here was a fire in the rear with which Mr. Lincoln's
administration was forced to reckon, and the reckoning
was a very serious one.</p>

<p>In 1864 the Democratic party at the North set
itself resolutely against the Lincoln administration,
and in opposition to all of its plans, to all of its policies
and to all of its performances. In a national
political platform, the Democratic party declared that
the war was a failure, and in effect called for the
abandonment of the Federal cause. For president
that party nominated General George B. McClellan,
a popular hero in the minds of many men, who was
held by them as he held himself, to have been baffled
in his military enterprises and robbed of his opportunities
by the political antagonism of the Washington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
administration, and by the prejudice that existed
in Congress against him as a Democrat.</p>

<p>Grant's failure to crush Lee in the field or so far
to occupy him at Petersburg, as to prevent him
from sending Early to threaten Washington, had
proved to be a very great discouragement to the
Northern people. The cost of the war in men, material
and money had been enormous, and there was
a widespread sentiment in the North to the effect
that it was hopeless to continue the contest. The
political feeling of Democrats in antagonism to the
Republican party which was represented by the administration
was intense and implacable.</p>

<p>There was also a party at the North which opposed
Lincoln's reëlection upon quite other grounds than
those on which the Democrats antagonized him. This
party was radical in the extreme. In its convention,
which was held at Cleveland, Ohio, at the end of May,
it declared itself in favor of an anti-slavery amendment
to the Constitution of the United States, and
even urged that the lands of the Southerners should
be confiscated and divided among the soldiers who
were fighting the war. On a platform of this kind
General John C. Fremont, who had resigned from
the army because of what he regarded as ill treatment
at the hand of the administration, was nominated for
President. There was not the smallest chance, of
course, that Fremont could be elected upon a platform
such as this, but his candidacy seemed likely to
withdraw from Lincoln a considerable vote, which
would otherwise be his.</p>

<p>The Republican Convention met in Baltimore on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
the seventh of June and renominated Mr. Lincoln for
President on a platform strongly approving his conduct
of the war and reaffirming the views that he had
expressed from time to time concerning it. At the
same time Andrew Johnson, of Tennessee, was nominated
for Vice-President. Johnson was a Southerner
and was at that time acting as military governor
of Tennessee. He had always been a Democrat, but
he had strongly favored the prosecution of the war
for the Union, and at that critical time when Mr.
Lincoln's reëlection seemed more than doubtful, it
was deemed politic thus to put a war Democrat on
the ticket with him, by way of holding to his support
that large body of Democratic voters who favored
the vigorous prosecution of the contest.</p>

<p>Although Johnson was himself a Southerner, it
would have been difficult to find any man more antagonistic
than he was to the ruling class of men at
the South. He had been born a "poor white,"&mdash;that
is to say, a member of that class at the South which
was everywhere held in contempt both by negroes and
by white men. He had received no education in his
childhood, and it is said, could neither read nor write
until after his marriage, when his wife taught him.
But he was a man of very considerable intellectual
ability, and by diligent work he had come into prominence
as a lawyer, before Mr. Lincoln selected him to
exercise the functions of military governor over the
practically recovered state of Tennessee. As every
reader knows, this selection of Johnson for Vice-President
proved in the end to be a thorn in the flesh
to the Republican party. Their Democratic Vice-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>President
was destined to succeed to the Presidency
by Mr. Lincoln's assassination, almost at the beginning
of his second term, and as President to do all
that he could to thwart and baffle the policies of the
party that had elected him.</p>

<p>When the Democratic Convention met in Chicago
on the twenty-ninth of August, the situation in the
field was such as greatly to discourage a large part of
the population at the North. The demands of the
Lincoln administration for more and more troops had
been incessant and insistent. These demands had
exhausted the willingness of the people to respond,
and the administration had been compelled to resort
to a forcible draft as a means of keeping up the
armies in the field. This resort to the policy of enforced
enlistment was everywhere bitterly resented.
It was held to be un-American, un-Republican,
despotic.</p>

<p>There was also the fact that Grant's great campaign
from which so much had been expected seemed
to a large part of the people to have been a failure.
Grant had not crushed Lee, but on the contrary, Lee
was so strong that he had pushed a column under
Early up to the very gates of Washington. At the
end of August Sherman had not yet succeeded in
taking Atlanta, but had suffered some severe reverses
in his effort to accomplish that object. At that time
also, critical discontent at the North was encouraged
by the spectacle of Sheridan standing on the defensive
in the Valley of Virginia against a force scarcely
more than one fourth as great as his own. There was
despair in many minds, and weariness in many more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
The resources of the country had been strained
well nigh to the point of breaking. Taxes of every
kind had been multiplied almost to the limit of ingenuity.
The credit of the country was so far impaired
that its paper currency had become depreciated
to less than one half its nominal value. The debt of
the nation had been swelled to thousands of millions,
while its productive capacity was being more and
more impaired by the withdrawal of young men by
hundreds of thousands from their farms and their
workshops. The country had given to Mr. Lincoln
soldiers by millions, and dollars by billions, and yet
the war went on with no apparent prospect of being
early brought to a successful end.</p>

<p>For to people uninstructed in military affairs,
there was little in the situation in the field at the end
of August, 1864, to encourage the hope of a speedy
ending of the struggle. The people generally did
not realize the great gain that had been made by
Grant's insistent pounding of the Confederates, nor
did they understand how surely his policy was weakening
and destroying the capacity of resistance on
the part of the South. Under these circumstances,
there was widespread discontent with the administration
and disgust over its seeming failure to accomplish
the purpose aimed at in the lavish expenditure of
money, and the enormous sacrifice of human life. A
feeling of despair had come over a very great part of
the Northern people, and to this feeling the Democratic
party in its platform made a strongly persuasive
appeal.</p>

<p>Among other things, the platform said, "that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
Convention does explicitly declare, as the sense of the
American people, that after four years of failure to
restore the Union by the experiment of war, during
which under the pretense of military necessity, of a
war power higher than the Constitution, the Constitution
itself has been disregarded in every part, and
public liberty and private right alike trodden down,
and the material prosperity of the country essentially
impaired&mdash;justice, humanity, liberty and the public
welfare demand that immediate efforts be made for
a cessation of hostilities with a view to an ultimate
Convention of all the States, or other peaceable
means, to the end that, at the earliest practicable
moment, peace may be restored on the basis of the
Federal union of the States.</p>

<p>"That the aim and object of the Democratic party
is to preserve the Federal union, and the rights of the
states unimpaired."</p>

<p>It is obvious enough to us now that the election of
McClellan upon that platform would have meant the
surrender by the United States of every contention
on which the war had been prosecuted. It would have
been, in effect, the triumph of the Confederacy. In
any convention that might have been called to reconstruct
the Union under such conditions, the South
as the winning party in the war, would of course have
dictated its own terms.</p>

<p>For a time there seemed to be a very strong prospect
that precisely this would happen. The weariness
of the people with the war, the discontent aroused by
excessive taxation, and by the continued slaughter of
the youth of the land, the despair of bankers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
business men over the never ceasing depreciation of
the currency,&mdash;all these and other influences tended
very strongly to invite a favorable response from the
people to this appeal of a political party.</p>

<p>It was the opinion of many shrewd observers of
that time, and is the opinion to-day of many students
of history who have closely considered the facts, that
if the election had occurred at the beginning of
September, 1864, there would have been a decisive
majority of voters in favor of this policy of surrender.
But the election did not occur until November, and
in the meanwhile the military situation was vastly
changed. Sherman had taken Atlanta before November
came, the Confederate army under Hood had
been put in the way of being crushed in Tennessee,
Sheridan had made himself master of the Valley of
Virginia, and Grant was steadily extending his lines
southward and westward at Petersburg, in a way
which even the unmilitary observer must recognize
at last as a process foredooming Lee to destruction.</p>

<p>Under the influence of these changed conditions in
the field, Mr. Lincoln was reëlected with a popular
majority of about 400,000 and an electoral majority
of 212 to 21. There was contention at the time that
the votes of the soldiers in the field were juggled with
and falsified. It is highly improbable that anything
of that kind was done or attempted in any considerable
measure. It is certain that the election, as it
resulted, represented the determination of the North
to prosecute the war to its end.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Sherman at Atlanta</span></span></h2>

<p>Sherman occupied Atlanta on the second day of
September, 1864, the Confederates retiring without
a further struggle to a strong position east of the
city.</p>

<p>Sherman almost immediately decided to depopulate
the town and make of it a rigidly military stronghold.
To that end he ordered all the inhabitants, old and
young, sick and well, men, women and children alike,
to leave the place. He gave to each the choice of
fleeing northward or southward as each might elect,
but all must go. All these helpless non-combatants
must abandon their homes, surrender whatever they
possessed of bread-winning employments and go
forth among strangers helpless and forlorn objects of
charity.</p>

<p>Even that "hellishness" which Sherman attributed
to war, could scarcely have given birth to a crueller
order than this. Sherman always justified it in apparent
apology to his own conscience, upon the
ground that his army was placed in a perilous position
in the heart of an enemy's country with a long
and exceedingly vulnerable line of communication
by one single-track railroad, and that the presence
of non-combatants in Atlanta, most of them hostile
to his purposes, must be an additional source of
danger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
The necessities of war have always been held to
justify or at least excuse many things that would
otherwise be deemed barbaric and even savage in
their cruel inhumanity. That plea of military necessity
rests upon the assumption that the purposes of
war are of so supreme moment, and in themselves so
clearly righteous, that they should be prosecuted to
success regardless of human suffering and regardless
of all other considerations; that they should be insisted
upon in utter disregard of the suffering even
of those non-combatant women and children upon
whom such war-decrees as this fall with an excess
of cruelty.</p>

<p>In every such case as this, the commander who
issues the decree is himself sole and arbitrary judge
of the extent of his necessity. What if he judges
wrongly? What if he permits considerations of his
own convenience to outweigh all other arguments,
and, for the sake of his own repose in his headquarters
wantonly condemns many innocent, helpless, and
in no way offensive, women and little children and
men sorely stricken with age, to a banishment which
must mean to many of them a long period of suffering
with lingering and painful death by the wayside
as an incident? What if he is moved to the issue of
such an order merely by way of saving himself and
his army from the trouble of effectually guarding
a position which due diligence might sufficiently
protect?</p>

<p>At the beginning of the war and indeed throughout
its progress, Washington City had multitudes of
people in it whose sympathies were with the Southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
cause, and who daily communicated by one means
or another with the Confederates in Virginia. Would
McClellan have been justified by the facts, in ordering
the utter depopulation of the Federal city, and
the sending into exile of every man, woman and child
dwelling there and not enlisted in the military service?
Did any commander on either side ever think
of depopulating Harper's Ferry or Winchester or
Martinsburg, although throughout the struggle those
points of strategic importance were inhabited about
equally by Northern and Southern sympathizers.</p>

<p>It is true that at Atlanta General Sherman was in
a position of considerable danger and difficulty. But
he had deliberately placed himself in that position,
for the sake of the military advantages it might yield
to him; and moreover, he had almost phenomenally
overwhelming resources in men, money, food stuffs,
and all the other appliances of war, with which to
maintain himself there, in spite of anything and
everything that the non-combatants of the town
could have done to annoy him. Impartial history
must therefore earnestly challenge his order for the
depopulation of Atlanta, asking whether its cruelty
was really a military necessity or whether it was
merely a resort of convenience, intended to save an
invading army and its commander from petty annoyance.
Did not General Sherman by this order of
depopulation needlessly add to the suffering of non-combatants?
Was his military necessity at that time
so great&mdash;when he had only a badly crippled army to
contend against, and when he had three or four men
to its one&mdash;was his military extremity so great, history
will ask, as to justify this enormous cruelty?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
General Sherman always contended that it was.
In his correspondence with Hood at the time, in his
letters of explanation to Halleck and Grant, and
finally in his "Memoirs" published years afterwards,
he defended his action vigorously and even angrily,
as a military necessity, but always in such fashion as
to suggest that he felt it necessary to defend himself
and his fame, in the forum of civilization, and to
make out a sufficient case of military necessity to
excuse that which he felt that humanity shrank from
as a cruel and barbaric expedient.</p>

<p>These questions belong to biography and the literature
of personal controversy. It is the function of
history merely to record the facts. The facts in this
case are that Sherman depopulated Atlanta, sending
its helpless people into exile, and ruthlessly destroying
the greater part of their homes in order, as he
himself explained, to contract his lines of defense,
reduce the city and all its suburbs to the dimensions
of a military post easily held, and spare himself the
necessity of maintaining a multitude of provost
guards and detailing large bodies of troops to hold a
populated place, where very small bodies might hold
one depopulated.</p>

<p>It is certain that enormous human suffering resulted
from his decree. It is certain that women and
children and aged persons perished because of it.
Whether it was really a measure of military necessity,
or only a measure prompted by ill temper, or a measure
intended to save trouble to an invading army,
each reader must judge for himself. In judging, the
reader should remember that no such thing was done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
at Memphis or Nashville or Chattanooga; that Grant
adopted no such measure after he conquered Vicksburg;
that even Benjamin F. Butler, whose disposition
it always was to employ all the technicalities of
the law in defense of arbitrary measures against his
enemies, never for one moment thought of depopulating
New Orleans during his occupancy of that
city. The depopulation of Atlanta by the fiat of a
military commander stands out in relief as the only
occurrence of the kind that marked or marred the conduct
of the war on either side. It must be judged
upon its own merits without parallel or precedent to
guide the mind that inquires concerning its humanity
or its inhumanity.</p>

<p>In securing possession of Atlanta Sherman had
fully accomplished one of the supreme purposes of
the campaign which Grant had marked out as the
objects of all the operations of all the armies during
the summer of 1864. He had indeed accomplished
quite all that Grant had set him to accomplish during
that season. His success had been completer than
Grant's own in fact, for he had overcome the Confederate
army in his front and, after a series of hotly
contested battles and a brilliant display of grand
strategy on both sides, he had completely achieved
the objective of the campaign marked out for him.
Hood's further resistance was both problematical and
well nigh hopeless in view of the enormous disparity
of numbers between the two armies. On the other
hand Grant had failed in his twin purposes of crushing
the Army of Northern Virginia in the field, and
making himself master of the Confederate capital
city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
In his dispatches to Sherman at the time, Grant
fully and generously recognized all this, taking pains
even to emphasize the fact that his great lieutenant's
success had been completer than his own.</p>

<p>But when he had settled himself in Atlanta, depopulated
the town and sent its helpless people into
exile, Sherman found himself in a sore predicament.
His sole base of supplies was at Chattanooga&mdash;a hundred
miles away&mdash;and his only line of communication
with that base was a single track railroad running
through a hostile country and subject to interruption
at any hour. His enemy occupied a position near
Atlanta from which he could not be dislodged without
fearful slaughter, and the enterprise of that enemy in
attacks upon the Federal line of communications was
hourly made evident. Sherman's problem of future
operations was an exceedingly perplexing one. But
whatever its decision might ultimately be, he prepared
himself for it by bringing forward great
quantities of provisions and ammunition and strengthening
his rear in every possible way. At every station
on the line of railroad between Atlanta and
Chattanooga, he placed small bodies of men, entrenching
them to resist cavalry. At important points he
built strong blockhouses for further defense.</p>

<p>More important still, in anticipation of a northward
advance of the Confederates, he asked for and
secured strong reinforcements for Thomas, whom
he had stationed at Nashville, with command of
all the strategic points in Tennessee and Northern
Georgia.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Sherman himself was watching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
Hood, and meditating upon the question of what further
movements he might undertake with his army at
Atlanta, now that he had effectually secured Nashville,
Chattanooga and the other strategic points
north of his position.</p>

<p>He was also busily engaged in diplomacy. At that
time there was widespread discontent at the South
with the conduct of the war and not a little despair.
To many minds, including those of a number of influential
statesmen, the conviction had come that all
hope of the ultimate success of the Confederate cause
had passed away, and that it was high time to give up
the effort and make peace while yet the South's resisting
power was great enough to serve as an argument
in behalf of favorable terms.</p>

<p>In North Carolina this sentiment took form in the
open candidacy of Mr. Holden for the governorship
on a platform which advocated the secession of that
state from the Confederacy, and the conclusion of
peace between the United States and North Carolina
as an independent sovereignty entirely free to return
at will to the Union.</p>

<p>This was logical enough, but it was of course impracticable.
The foundation stone of the Confederacy
was the contention that each state was
independently sovereign and could withdraw at its
own good pleasure from any union or confederacy
into which it might have entered. But logic or no
logic, law or no law, sovereignty or subjection, it was
certain that while war was on the Richmond government
would never permit North Carolina to withdraw
from the Confederacy and become again one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
of the United States. The geographical position of
North Carolina was such that Confederate consent
to such a program would have been Confederate suicide.
Nevertheless, and in face of the certainty of
Confederate warfare, the candidate who advocated
this course received 20,000 votes against his adversary's
54,000.</p>

<p>In Georgia the discontent took a form even more
dangerous to Confederate interests. The Governor
of that state, Joseph E. Brown, was almost in open
rebellion against the Richmond government. On the
tenth of September he recalled and furloughed all
the Georgia militia that had been serving under
Johnston and afterwards under Hood, thus seriously
weakening Hood's already inferior force at a time
when it stood in peculiar need of strengthening. He
still further claimed for his state the right to recall
from the Confederate armies everywhere all the
Georgia troops that were enlisted in that service.
With the scarcely disguised purpose of thus taking
Georgia out of the Confederacy and making a separate
peace for that state, he issued a summons for
the legislature to meet almost immediately.</p>

<p>Further than this, Georgia's most famous statesman
and by all odds that state's most influential citizen
was Alexander H. Stephens. Mr. Stephens had
opposed secession to the bitter end and his selection
to be Vice-President of the Confederacy had clearly
been dictated by the desire of the politicians to placate
him and the multitude of strong Union men who
looked to him for leadership. Mr. Stephens had at no
time during the war been on terms of intimacy with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
Mr. Davis. Mr. Davis could not distrust the integrity
of such a man, but he always distrusted his sympathy
with the plans and purposes of the Richmond
Government, and when the grave discontent arose in
Georgia, he attributed it largely to the influence of
Mr. Stephens's sentiments. For these were everywhere
known.</p>

<p>Mr. Stephens believed firmly in the constitutional
right of secession, but, in common with many others,
and especially in common with the Virginians, he had
from the first held that secession was uncalled for by
anything that Mr. Lincoln's election in 1860 implied
or threatened. He had insisted upon love for the
Union as stoutly as Alexander Hamilton himself&mdash;for
whom Mr. Stephens was named&mdash;could have done.
Believing as he did firmly in the right of a state to
secede and in the paramount obligation of every citizen
to yield allegiance to his state, Mr. Stephens accepted
Georgia's secession without in the least approving
it.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1864 he was convinced, as many
other thinking men at the South were, that the military
problems of the war had been in effect decided;
that there was absolutely no further ground for hope
of Southern success, and that further continuance of
the war could mean nothing else than a needless sacrifice
of life and of the substance of the people. He
made no concealment of these views and the number
of Southern men who shared them grew daily greater.</p>

<p>These men felt that in view of the inevitableness of
Confederate failure in the end, it was the duty of the
Richmond government to seek terms while yet it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
had something to offer in exchange for terms. Mr.
Lincoln's supreme desire, it was well known, was to
secure the restoration of the Union. He had often,
emphatically, and very eloquently, proclaimed that as
the sole purpose of his mind and heart, and had declared
insistently his readiness and eagerness to sacrifice
all other considerations for the sake of that one
object. His influence at the North was so clearly all
dominating that there could be no doubt of the ready
acceptance by Congress and the people, of any arrangement
he might make with the seceding states
for their restoration to the Union. Mr. Stephens and
those who agreed with him in mind, held that now
was the time to recognize facts and take the utmost
possible advantage of conditions as they existed.
Mr. Lincoln was anxious well nigh to the verge of
sacrifice, to crown his lifework by the restoration of
the Union, and "the people said 'Amen.'"</p>

<p>While the Southern cause was obviously hopeless
of ultimate success the South still had veteran armies
in the field, under command of generals who perfectly
knew how to use them destructively. It was manifest
that if the war were to continue, these armies would
inflict vast slaughter&mdash;as in the event they did&mdash;upon
the Federal forces, and enormously increase the already
stupendous cost of the war to the North. In
brief it was certain that if negotiations should be
undertaken then the South could secure better terms
than would be granted if the struggle should be prolonged
until the South could fight no more. So long
as Lee's army was intact&mdash;however surely its ultimate
destruction could be counted upon&mdash;its very existence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
and its matchless fighting capacity, must offer to the
Washington government a very strong inducement
to give lenient terms for the sake of ending the war
without the further effusion of blood and the further
expenditure of treasure.</p>

<p>In commercial parlance the South at that time had
something to trade on&mdash;something with which to buy
favorable terms of peace; a little later, as these wise
men foresaw, she would have nothing and must accept
whatever terms her triumphant adversary might see
fit to impose.</p>

<p>This condition of things was revealed to General
Sherman about the time of his occupation of Atlanta,
and he eagerly sought to take such advantage
of it as might lead to a prompt ending of the war
by the political disintegration of the Confederacy.
About that time two men of prominence in Georgia
sought permission to enter the Federal lines under
safe conduct in order to secure and take home the
body of a Confederate officer who had been killed in
battle. Both of these men were influential and one
of them had been a member of Congress before the
war. Sherman not only granted their request but
received and entertained them at his headquarters.
Having got some inkling of Governor Brown's attitude
and state of mind, Sherman seized the opportunity
to send messages to that revolting state
executive. He intimated to him a purpose presently
to march over a great part of the state, and declared
that if Governor Brown would withdraw Georgia's
quota of troops from the Confederate army, he,
Sherman, would confine his men on march to the high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
roads and pay for all supplies taken from the country.
Otherwise, it was plainly suggested, his march
would be a desolating one.</p>

<p>The negotiations came to no practical result. The
march was made, and the desolation of it was well-nigh
unmatched in the world's annals. But the historical
fact that such a negotiation was carried on
between a Federal commanding general and the
governor of a Confederate state, with distinguished
and influential citizens of that state for go-betweens,
is interesting in itself and still more interesting as an
illustration of the condition into which the events of
the great struggle had brought the Southern mind.</p>

<p>About this time President Jefferson Davis of the
Confederacy visited the South and made speeches
there not only to the people but to the men of Hood's
army. In these speeches he bitterly assailed not only
Governor Brown but also General Joseph E. Johnston,
plainly suggesting that he regarded both as
scarcely better than traitors to the Southern cause.
Governor Brown's attitude and action in withdrawing
the Georgia militia from Hood's army, in negotiating
with Sherman and in summoning the legislature
with the scarcely disguised purpose of recalling
all Georgia troops from the Confederate armies at
the time of their sorest need, legitimately bore such
construction, perhaps. But General Johnston's only
offense was his inability, with a vastly inferior army,
to overcome Sherman and prevent his advance toward
Atlanta. Johnston's fighting retreat is very differently
judged by all historians and all military critics.
General Sherman himself, to the end of his life, always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
spoke of it as one of the most masterly operations
of the war, and no impartial mind can come to
any other conclusion after studying the conditions
and considering the factors of the problem.</p>

<p>But Mr. Davis's animosity toward Johnston was
of long standing and it was implacable. History will
scarcely reckon Johnston among the great commanders,
but it will always account him a very capable one.
Certainly it will reckon his retirement toward Atlanta
in presence of Sherman's vastly superior and most
capably commanded force, as an enforced retreat
conducted with all the skill that any military genius
could have brought to bear upon it, and so conducted
as to inflict the maximum of injury upon the enemy,
while suffering the minimum of hurt in return.</p>

<p>The simple fact, as history sees it clearly, is that
Johnston's force was utterly inadequate to check
Sherman's advance. He did the best he could and far
better than most commanders in like circumstances
could have done. He made Sherman's advance as
costly and as slow as it was possible for any general
with so inferior a force to make it.</p>

<p>But he had not destroyed Sherman's army or prevented
its approach to Atlanta. He had not been
able to make one man equal to three, and Mr. Davis
bitterly resented his incapacity to work these wonders.
Mr. Davis had removed Johnston from command
and had put Hood in his place. So he told the
Confederate soldiers, in his speeches, that a new era
was dawning, and explained to them Hood's plan of
campaign, which, insane as it was, appealed to their
imaginations and fired them with an enthusiasm which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
meant enormous slaughter in the operations presently
to be undertaken by the madman who had replaced a
wise and discreet general in command of the Confederate
army before Atlanta.</p>

<p>A more important fact is that Davis's speeches,
outlining the plan of campaign, were published in the
Southern newspapers, copies of which came to Sherman
every day. Thus the Federal general learned in
advance precisely what his adversary intended to do
or to attempt, and was forearmed by the forewarning.</p>

<p>Hood's plan thus revealed to Sherman was to operate
toward the north, destroying the Federal general's
communication with Chattanooga, and then
advancing against the strongholds of Chattanooga
and Nashville.</p>

<p>It is doubtful that an insaner plan of campaign
than this was ever devised by any man in command
of a great army. It left Sherman free to work his
will in Georgia. It withdrew practically all resistance
from his front, while the threat to his rear which
it implied was scarcely worthy of consideration. For
with Thomas at Nashville and adequate forces at
Chattanooga and elsewhere it was as certain as anything
in war can be, that Hood could accomplish
nothing in his northward march except his own
destruction.</p>

<p>About the beginning of October Hood cut loose
from his communications, abandoning every trustworthy
and secure source of supply and, leaving his
enemy in overwhelming force in his rear, moved
northward. It was easy for him to break the railroad
line by which Sherman had received supplies, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
Sherman had already brought vast stores of food
and ammunition to Atlanta and was for the time
being quite independent of his communications. He
promptly pushed a column out in pursuit of Hood
and by signals called General Corse from the northward
to the support of a small force that was holding
Allatoona. There a sharp fight occurred, ending in
a check to the Confederates. General Corse had an
ear shot off and a cheek bone carried away by a bullet,
but, treating his wounds lightly, he telegraphed to
Sherman, "I am short a cheek bone and an ear, but
am able to whip all hell yet."</p>

<p>Hood did great damage to the railroad and then
continued his march northward. After following him
for a while Sherman decided to leave Thomas to take
care of him, and himself to begin the march to the
sea.</p>

<p>Thomas was amply able to meet and defeat any
effort that Hood might make, as the event proved,
and Sherman, with no adversary south of him, was
free to carry out his purpose of marching through
the Confederacy, again splitting it into halves and
demonstrating his theory, that all that remained of
it was "an empty eggshell which only needs to be
punctured." He decided at once to puncture it.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_LVI" id="CHAPTER_LVI">CHAPTER LVI</a><br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Sherman's "March to the Sea"</span></span></h2>

<p>Upon reaching this decision, which had the approval
both of General Grant and of the War Department,
Sherman's first thought was to equip Thomas for the
task of dealing successfully with Hood. He detached
strong army corps from his own force and sent
them to Thomas's reinforcement. He ordered the
prompt abandonment of all unimportant posts held
in Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia and
Alabama, sending their garrisons to Nashville or
Chattanooga, still further to strengthen his lieutenant
for independent resistance. He asked Grant to
send to Thomas also all the recruits that had been
gathering at various points in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,
Kentucky and Tennessee. In these ways he secured
for Thomas a total force much stronger than Hood's,
and knowing Thomas's capacity he felt himself entirely
justified in leaving the defense of the Tennessee
strongholds to that general with orders to follow
Hood whithersoever he should go and in the end destroy
him.</p>

<p>Then Sherman completed the work of destruction
which Hood had begun upon the railway line between
Atlanta and Chattanooga. By way of stripping himself
for action he sent to the North every sick man,
every wounded man and every other man in his army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
whom he deemed less than perfectly fit for the arduous
work now to be undertaken and when that was
done he utterly destroyed all that remained of the
railroad.</p>

<p>He stripped his army of all baggage that could
in any wise be dispensed with, but organized perhaps
the greatest wagon train that any army had ever carried
with it, for the transportation of food supplies
and ammunition. His was now an army without a
base and without communications. It was his purpose
to subsist his men upon such supplies as he could
take from the country through which he intended to
march, but for the sake of perfect security he planned
to carry fully ten days' rations with him at all times,
or quite enough to feed his army on short rations for
three or four weeks in the event of necessity.</p>

<p>Now that Hood had gone northward, Sherman
knew that he had no enemy in his pathway except an
insignificant cavalry force, and that he might march
whithersoever he pleased without fear of serious
molestation or opposition. With ten days' full rations
in his wagon train and with the country to live
upon there was simply no possibility of harm coming
to him or his army.</p>

<p>He hoped that one or other of the expeditions
planned by Grant against the southern Atlantic
coast might reduce the defenses of Savannah and
capture that city before his arrival there. If not, he
had force enough to take the town himself, or, failing
that, to capture Charleston or Mobile or Wilmington,
in any case establishing a new base for himself on
the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
Many years later, at the Authors Club in New
York, in the presence of the writer of these volumes,
some one mentioned this operation to General Sherman,
speaking of it as "The March to the Sea."
Thereupon General Sherman turned to the writer
and said&mdash;as nearly as a good memory can <span class="locked">report&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Just see how poets glorify things! That march was nothing
more than a change of base,&mdash;an operation perfectly
familiar to every educated soldier. But a poet got hold
of it, nicknamed it "Sherman's March to the Sea," and gave
it a totally new significance to the popular mind. Let
me explain. At Atlanta I was in the midst of the enemy's
country. My nearest base of supplies was Chattanooga&mdash;a
hundred miles away. That place was itself liable to siege,
and it lay the width of two states away from my real and
ultimate source of supplies on the Ohio. The enemy might
cut it off at any time and even if he failed to do that, I
could not defend the hundred miles of single track railroad
that connected it with Atlanta. At Atlanta my army was
in the air. Its communications were likely to be cut at any
moment. Obviously, I must either retire northward from
that place, or I must move southward in search of a new
base of supplies. As there was no force south of me capable
of resisting my advance in that direction, I decided to
march toward the south, thus securing a new base for my
self within easy sea communication with sources of supply
at the north, and at the same time cutting the Confederacy
in two again and, more important still, demonstrating the
nearly complete collapse of the Confederate power of resistance.
So I decided to make the march and change my
base. That is all there was of it. But the poet got hold
of it&mdash;and so instead of a "military change of base," it has
become the "March to the <span class="locked">Sea."<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> This report of General Sherman's words was written out while
memory was fresh, submitted to General Sherman and approved by him
as correct.&mdash;Author.</p></div>

<p>Sherman's first plan with respect to Atlanta had
been to make a great military fortress of the place.
To that end, as we already know, he had issued his
decree of depopulation. Now that he had decided to
abandon the town he destroyed it by fire.</p>

<p>His plan of march through Georgia was to move in
four columns upon parallel roads, throwing out
foragers in every direction to seize upon every ounce
of food supplies that still remained in the country,
to burn all mills, to capture all live stock, to seize upon
all grain and to strip the region bare even of poultry
and vegetables. It was to cut a swath of utter desolation
through Georgia&mdash;a swath sixty miles wide
and nearly three hundred miles long&mdash;in every square
mile of which he should "make a solitude and call it
peace."</p>

<p>The desolating march began on the fifteenth of
November, Atlanta being left in ashes and smoldering
ruins. Under Sherman's marching orders, houses
were not to be entered by the soldiers&mdash;but those orders
were freely disregarded. Only corps commanders
were privileged to burn mills, cotton gins and the
like; but there were matches in every pocket and they
were used with little if any respect for orders which
nobody regarded seriously as commands intended to
be obeyed. The orders included a provision that
wherever the inhabitants should "manifest local hostility,
army commanders should order and enforce a
devastation more or less relentless according to the
measure of such hostility."</p>

<p>Under such orders the progress of the army was
marked at every step by devastation and desolation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
General Sherman always contended that he did not
intend it to be so, but to a victorious and practically
unopposed army, moving through an enemy's country,
such orders as those that General Sherman issued
could not be expected to result in anything less than
the utmost possible destruction. In express terms,
his orders authorized the cavalry and artillery to "appropriate
freely and without limit," the "horses,
mules, wagons, etc., belonging to the inhabitants,"
and soldiers were authorized to "gather turnips, potatoes,
and other vegetables and to drive in stock in
sight of their camp." It was suggested in the orders
that "in all foraging the parties engaged will endeavor
to leave with each family a reasonable portion
for their maintenance." But as to what constituted
such "reasonable portion" of the property of non-combatants
thus to be plundered of their substance,
every foraging party was left to be sole judge. No
instructions were given for the enforcement of this
saving clause of the orders by any authority and in
fact it was never enforced.</p>

<p>Sherman's army, moving in four columns over a
track sixty miles wide, simply seized upon everything
that it found, destroying what it could not use, and
there followed it a corps of utterly irresponsible camp
followers&mdash;plain, simple thieves and robbers&mdash;who
completed the devastation by taking or wantonly destroying
whatever the foraging parties had overlooked
or spared.</p>

<p>The hideousness of war was never better illustrated
than in Sherman's march to the sea. Its wantonness
was never more conspicuously shown forth, than in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
a military operation which had absolutely nothing of
glory in it, inasmuch as it involved no battle, no possible
risk of encounter with any force, and no enterprise
more daring than raids upon barnyards and
turnip patches. An army of more than sixty-two
thousand men and sixty-five guns, perfectly equipped
and utterly unopposed by any force that could even
pretend to give battle to it, moved over a space of
nearly three hundred miles, making war only upon
non-combatants and leaving a blackened path of
desolation behind. It fought no battles&mdash;for the
reason that there was no army anywhere to fight. It
engaged in no strategy&mdash;for the reason that there
was no enemy to maneuver against. It encountered
no more risk than does a picnic excursion in time of
profound peace. Yet at every foot of its progress it
wrought such havoc among a helpless people as even
grim-visaged war might well blush to own.</p>

<p>It was entirely proper that General Sherman
should march his army to the sea by way of changing
its base and demonstrating the incapacity of the Confederate
country for further resistance. It was entirely
proper that on such a march he should draw
upon the country for the means of subsisting his
army. But all this might have been done by a man
of Sherman's commanding ability, armed with such
resources as he had under his hand without inflicting
anything of hardship upon the helpless people whose
homes he rendered desolate and from whose mouths
he snatched away the little that was left to them of
food.</p>

<p>After an exceedingly slow march of nearly thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
days, Sherman's army in perfect condition reached
the defenses of Savannah on the thirteenth of December.
Easily sweeping over Fort McAllister
Sherman established communication with the blockading
fleet and the "March to the Sea" was finished.
On the morning of the twenty-first his troops marched
into Savannah, which the Confederates had evacuated.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Hood's Campaign</span></span></h2>

<p>In the meanwhile Hood had moved northward from
in front of Atlanta. His hope had been to draw
Sherman in pursuit and induce him to leave the Confederate
city. When Sherman shunned the bait and
stayed in Atlanta arranging for his march to the sea,
Hood set out to assail Thomas at Chattanooga.</p>

<p>It was an absurdly impracticable campaign, which
could not possibly result in anything of advantage
to the Confederates except the incidental slaughter
of a good many thousands of Federal soldiers with
no consequent improvement of Confederate prospects.</p>

<p>Hood had with him about 40,000 men, or nearly
that. They were as good men as any in the South,
and their organization and discipline were perfect.
But they were led upon a wild-goose chase by an incapable
commander whose leadership gave them opportunities
of heroism, indeed, but doomed them on
the other hand to hopeless enterprise and wholly
profitless slaughter.</p>

<p>Hood first met his enemy under Schofield, at Duck
river, forty miles or so south of Nashville. He
quickly and easily flanked the position and compelled
Schofield to retreat to Franklin, eighteen miles south
of Nashville. There, during the afternoon of November<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
thirtieth, Hood delivered a tremendous assault.
He carried the front line easily and rushed
onward to assail the second. Again he succeeded in
a struggle that extended itself far into the night.</p>

<p>At midnight Schofield was driven from his works
and retreated to Nashville. Thither Hood followed
him with that impetuosity that characterized the indiscretion
of the new Confederate commander.</p>

<p>Then followed a long pause&mdash;Hood could not in
any wise tempt Thomas into field battle and Thomas
was too strongly entrenched for even Hood, with all
his daring indiscretion, to attack him in his works.</p>

<p>It was not until the fifteenth of December that
Thomas struck. When he did so it was with tremendous
force and determination. He crushed Hood's
entrenched left flank and forced him back to a new
line of entrenchments in the rear.</p>

<p>On the next day Thomas renewed the attack with
his entire army, and succeeded in completely destroying
Hood's resisting power and driving his force into
broken and disastrous retreat. Thus ended Hood's
ill-judged but audacious campaign.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Sherman had reached Savannah
and his plan of campaign was completely successful
at both its ends. The Confederacy was again split in
two, and there remained in the gulf states no Confederate
army capable of offering anything like effective
resistance to any operations that Federal
armies might have undertaken. Had he been so
minded Thomas might have launched a column
against Mobile or Wilmington or Charleston with the
practical certainty that it would nowhere encounter
an opposition which it need seriously consider.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
All that now remained of Confederate strength lay
in Lee's little army around Petersburg and Richmond,
and in such fragments of armies as General
Joseph E. Johnston was presently to gather together
with the retreating garrison of Savannah and what
remained of Hood's army as a nucleus.</p>

<p>The time was drawing near when Grant was to deliver
his final blow and at last make an end of the war.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Preparations for the Decisive Blow</span></span></h2>

<p>The situation of the Confederates was now desperate
in the extreme. During January an expedition
ordered by Grant captured Fort Fisher, at the mouth
of Cape Fear river, and made itself master of Wilmington,
North Carolina. New Orleans had long
ago fallen, Mobile had been completely closed by
Farragut's Bay fight and Sherman had secured
possession of Savannah. Charleston was the only
Southern port still in possession of the Confederates,
and Sherman was already threatening that from the
rear in such fashion as to render it useless as an
avenue of supplies.</p>

<p>The county west of the Mississippi was completely
cut off. Georgia had been desolated and all the railroads
that might otherwise have carried supplies from
Alabama and Mississippi to Lee's army were destroyed.
Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Arkansas
and Louisiana were in possession of Federal troops.
Sheridan had reduced the Valley of Virginia to the
condition of a desert, while Grant's forces at Petersburg
held the Weldon railroad and were rapidly pushing
their works toward the South Side railroad which
connected Petersburg with Lynchburg. They were
also threatening the Richmond and Danville railroad&mdash;Lee's
last line of communication southward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
In the meanwhile Sherman was preparing to move
northward from Savannah, opposed only by Johnston's
army of fragments, and to form a junction with
Grant.</p>

<p>Obviously the end was drawing near. Obviously it
was the duty of the Confederate Government to make
the best terms it could for the ending of the war. It
still had Lee's army, and that army was even yet a
force to be reckoned with by its adversary. It could
still offer to the enemy a choice between the granting
of favorable terms of peace on the one hand and the
endurance of such further slaughter as Lee's army
could inflict on the other. The Confederacy still had
in its hands a fighting capacity that might serve as
legal tender in the purchase of peace conditions. It
was perfectly well known that Mr. Lincoln and indeed
the whole North were eager to end the war upon
any reasonable terms that might secure the restoration
of the Union without a further effusion of blood or
a further expenditure of the nation's substance.</p>

<p>It was absolutely certain now that the Confederacy
could never win its independence. It was absolutely
certain that every day's further fighting must
reduce that resisting capacity upon which alone the
Southern people could rely as a means of securing
terms other than those of unconditional surrender.</p>

<p>In view of these obvious conditions an effort was
made in February, 1865, to bring about a peace.
A Confederate Commission, with Alexander H.
Stephens, Vice-President of the Confederacy, at its
head, met Mr. Lincoln and others on board ship in
Hampton Roads to discuss the question of ending the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
war. Mr. Lincoln and his advisers were eager to stop
the conflict without further bloodshed. They demanded
only the restoration of the Union and the
abolition of slavery in accordance with the terms of
the emancipation proclamation. All else they were
willing to concede. They were ready to admit all the
seceding states to the Union again upon equal terms;
to grant universal amnesty; to recognize all the state
governments; to set free all military prisoners; to
give up all property held in capture; and to negotiate
for money compensation in every case in which hardship
should appear to have been inflicted upon individuals.</p>

<p>In brief Mr. Lincoln's supreme desire to end the
war in a complete restoration of Union, and to reëstablish
fellowship and good will among the states
was so dominant that the South might at that time
have made any terms it pleased, short of a dissolution
of the Union, or the reëstablishment of slavery.</p>

<p>Mr. Jefferson Davis decreed otherwise. Perfectly
knowing that the Confederate capacity of resistance
was nearing its end, and perfectly knowing that the
restoration of the Union was with Mr. Lincoln a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sine
qua non</i> of all negotiations, he deliberately and emphatically
instructed the Confederate Commissioners
not even to discuss that proposal. He thus practically
forbade all negotiations for peace. With the Confederacy
manifestly conquered Mr. Davis insisted
that its commissioners should adopt the attitude of
conquerors, dictating terms of peace to a vanquished
enemy.</p>

<p>The result was foredoomed, of course. Speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
of the affair years afterwards Mr. Stephens pithily
said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Davis carefully spiked all our guns and then
ordered us to the front."</p>

<p>It was about this time that Lee visited Mr. Davis
and explained the situation to him. He set forth the
fact that Grant, with his enormously superior force,
could indefinitely extend his lines to the left, thus
compelling the Confederate commander to stretch out
his own lines to nothingness; that Grant could, and
surely would, concentrate an overwhelming force at
some point and there irresistibly break through the
Confederate lines of defenses; and that when this
should be done, successful retreat would be impossible
to the Confederate army.</p>

<p>There is good historical ground for the belief that
General Lee at that time proposed an alternative
course of action. He asked Mr. Davis to give him
the negroes of the South as soldiers; to permit him
to put them into the defensive works, and thus set
his veterans free to make a last desperately determined
invasion of the North; or, if the negroes were
denied to him, that he should be permitted to abandon
the defense of Richmond and Petersburg, while retreat
was yet possible, retire to the line of the
Roanoke river, form a junction with such other
forces as the Confederacy still had at command and
make a final stand in the far interior against Grant.</p>

<p>It is credibly reported that Mr. Davis resolutely
refused to permit General Lee to carry out either of
these alternative plans; that he refused to permit the
enlistment of negroes and at the same time forbade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
General Lee to withdraw his army from the defense
of Richmond and Petersburg.</p>

<p>There was left to the great Confederate commander
only the duty of returning to his headquarters,
resisting while resistance was possible, and accepting
the inevitable end whenever the advance of
spring and the consequent hardening of the roads
should open the way for Grant to bring that end
about by a decisive movement.</p>

<p>The time was not yet ripe for the delivery of the
final blow. Mud still stood in the way; but while
awaiting his opportunity Grant continued those
operations in other quarters which effectually prevented
Lee's reinforcement and contributed in important
ways to the accomplishment of his ultimate
purpose. He kept Canby pounding at Mobile. He
drew from Thomas in Tennessee strong reinforcements
for the Army of the Potomac. In February
he directed Sheridan to move up the Valley of Virginia
in irresistible force, brush the remnant of
Early's army out of existence, destroy the locks of
the James river and Kanawha canal, cut the railroad
communications and then sweep like a hurricane eastward
to join the main army before Petersburg and
Richmond. At the same time he ordered a column
to move from Chattanooga eastward toward Lynchburg,
destroying the railroad as it marched and thus
additionally hemming Lee in and crippling him.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile his own pounding on Lee's lines
was ceaseless. The object of this was to occupy all
of Lee's attention and prevent him from detaching
troops for operations in any direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
Grant's lines now extended from a point north of
Richmond, eastward, southward and westward to
positions south and west of Petersburg, and at every
opportunity he was pushing his left wing farther
around Lee's flank, with the double purpose of still
further weakening the Confederates by attenuation
and rendering impossible the successful retreat of the
Army of Northern Virginia when the time should
come to concentrate an overwhelming Federal force
against some point in it and break through.</p>

<p>To meet this strategy General Lee undertook a bold
operation on the twenty-fourth of March which was
brilliantly, but in the end unsuccessfully, executed
by General Gordon. His plan was by an attack upon
the Federal left wing to compel Grant for a time to
contract his lines on the left and thus to secure to the
Confederates a way out of the net in which they had
been enmeshed. The attack was made in the night,
a fact which would have rendered it perilous in the
extreme had the troops that made it been other than
war-worn veterans. At the point selected for assault
the Federal and Confederate lines lay within one
hundred yards of each other, and both were strongly
fortified. By an adroit movement the Confederates
captured the whole body of Federal pickets and sent
them as prisoners to the rear, thus reducing the distance
between themselves and the earthworks to be
assaulted to less than fifty yards. Then with a rush
they hurled themselves upon the Federal works and
carried them. For a time it seemed likely that they
would crumple up the whole of Grant's left wing and
compel the contraction of his lines by several miles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
But General Parke, who commanded the Federal
forces in that quarter, made hurried dispositions to
check the Confederate assault, and after some hours
of hard fighting, in which the Confederates lost 4,000
men and the Federals 2,000, the Federal lines were
reëstablished.</p>

<p>All this occurred just before Grant's final and decisive
blow was delivered. Earlier in the war this
conflict would have been everywhere heralded as a
great battle. In the spring of 1865&mdash;so used had the
country become to such things&mdash;it was a scarcely
noticed incident in the siege operations about
Petersburg.</p></div>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The End</span></span></h2>

<p>While all this was going on around Petersburg,
Sherman, under Grant's instructions, was carrying
out the other part of the lieutenant general's program.
After securing possession of Savannah he
pushed troops forward to Pocotaligo, a point on the
Charleston and Savannah railroad about midway between
the two cities. From that position he could
move with equal ease against Charleston, Augusta,
or Columbia and the cities and towns north of Columbia.</p>

<p>General Joseph E. Johnston had been grudgingly
recalled to the command of such Confederate forces
as could be assembled in that quarter for the purpose
of offering resistance to that advance northwardly
which Sherman obviously intended. But for a time
Johnston could not know or safely conjecture by
which of the three lines of march that were equally
open to him, Sherman would elect to move. Consequently
for a time Johnston was compelled to
scatter his meager forces widely, holding them in such
readiness as he could for concentration when his
enemy's purposes should be disclosed.</p>

<p>On the first of February Sherman began his march.
Carefully spreading reports that Charleston on the
one hand or Augusta on the other was his destination,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
he moved swiftly upon Columbia, the capital city of
South Carolina.</p>

<p>It was Sherman's plan in this northward march to
keep the sea always at his back. He arranged for
the fleet to coöperate with him from beginning to end,
to bring supplies to the several points along the coast
that were held by the Federals and to preserve to him
at those points secure places of refuge to which he
might retreat in the event of his encountering disaster
in the field. His tactics were precisely those
adopted by Cornwallis in his contest with Greene in
1780, but with the modern improvement of a navy
driven by steam and therefore far more certain and
precise in its operations than that which supported
Cornwallis could be.</p>

<p>Sherman entered the city of Columbia on the seventeenth
of February. Thus far he had encountered
no opposition except such as the alert Confederate
cavalry under Wade Hampton could offer. For as
yet the uncertainty as to whither Sherman planned
to go compelled Johnston to keep his own forces
scattered over a line that stretched all the way from
Augusta to Charleston.</p>

<p>It was in South Carolina, of which Columbia is the
capital, that secession had been born. It was here that
South Carolina had proclaimed her withdrawal from
the Union and her independent sovereignty. It was
here that the war which had cost so much of life and
treasure and sacrifice and suffering had been born.
There was very naturally, among the now victorious
men of Sherman's command, a specially vengeful
feeling toward South Carolina and still more against
its capital city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
The cotton stored in that city was brought out and
piled in the middle of the broad streets. Presently it
was fired by some agency. The fire spread to the
buildings of the town, and the greater part of the
beautiful city was burned.</p>

<p>The Confederates have always insisted that Columbia
was wantonly burned by General Sherman's
order. General Sherman always denied the charge.
The controversy over that point in newspapers, pamphlets
and books, has filled space enough in print to
constitute a library.</p>

<p>It would quite uselessly encumber these pages to
present here, even in outline, the hopelessly conflicting
testimony that has been given on either side. All
of that testimony is accessible to every reader who
cares to follow it in controversial publications, and
it seems to lead to no safely definite conclusion.</p>

<p>Let us leave the matter here as one of the calamities
of war concerning which the responsibility is so
hopelessly involved in a mass of conflicting testimony
that no historian mindful of fairness can feel
himself safe in passing judgment with respect to it.
Columbia has been rebuilt in all its beauty. The
country in whose crown it is a jewel has grown to be
the greatest and freest on earth. Surely we can leave
the dead past to bury its dead, so far as such matters
as this are concerned.</p>

<p>From Columbia northward Sherman's advance was
contested at every step with all the vigor and determination
that General Joseph E. Johnston could
bring to bear. That able general was a grand master
of the art of so retreating as to make his retreat more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
costly to his enemy than an advance would have been.
His force was exceedingly small as compared with
Sherman's columns, but it was made up of veteran
troops, as good as ever stood up before an enemy, and
it was perfectly responsive to any and every demand
that its commanding general might make upon it
either for daring or for endurance.</p>

<p>The country through which Sherman had to march
was swampy, forest grown, and laced with watercourses
difficult to pass. Its roads were mere tracks
through woods and fields, which, when rain fell,
quickly became quagmires. At every stream Johnston's
ceaselessly active men burned the bridges and
obstructed the fords. In every forest stretch they
felled trees across the roads, and planting cannon in
commanding positions, rendered the progress of their
foes as dangerous as it was difficult. Wherever a
vantage ground lay, the Confederates&mdash;war-educated
as they were, and still determined&mdash;took position and
inch by inch contested the difficult ground. Not in
all the war was there an operation more gallant on
either side than this advance and retreat.</p>

<p>Still keeping the protecting sea on his right flank
which he could at any moment change into his rear,
Sherman left the ashes of Columbia on the twentieth
of February and advanced towards Fayetteville,
where he arrived on the eleventh of March.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the city of Wilmington, on the
coast, had been captured by General Terry's Fort
Fisher expedition, and communication was established
between Terry and Sherman. Thus a way was opened
by which both supplies and reinforcements might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
sent without limit or molestation to the army that was
for the third time cutting in twain what remained of
the Confederacy.</p>

<p>From Fayetteville, Sherman pushed on to Goldsboro
fighting with Johnston's desperate Confederates
at every step. Thence he advanced toward Raleigh,
the capital city of North Carolina.</p>

<p>At Averysboro, a point between, the two armies
came into direct collision on the sixteenth of March
and each lost about half a thousand men in a severe
conflict. Three days later on the nineteenth they met
again at Bentonville and in a small, but bloody conflict,
the Federals lost 1,600 men and the Confederates
somewhat more than 2,000.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, at Goldsboro, Sherman had been
reinforced by the whole of Schofield's corps, withdrawn
from Thomas's force at Nashville. This addition
to his force rendered his army almost ridiculously
superior in numbers to that of his adversary. That,
under Grant's direction, was always the keynote of
tactics and strategy. From beginning to end of his
campaigns Grant held to the doctrine of "the most
men." Seeing clearly that the North could put three
or four men into the field to the South's one, he regarded
it as very clearly his duty, as the commander
in chief of the Federal forces, to see to it that wherever
a fight was to occur, the three or four should be
present to meet and overcome the one.</p>

<p>The fierce struggle at Bentonville which for a time
seemed of very doubtful issue, was the last battle of
consequence fought between Sherman and Johnston.</p>

<p>Let us go back now to Petersburg, where the hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
of the final struggle drew near. The reader has already
been told of Lee's effort to compel Grant to
contract his lines south and west of Petersburg. That
effort was made on the night of the twenty-fourth of
March and the morning of the twenty-fifth.</p>

<p>The spring was advancing now. The roads were
hardening. Grant had all the force that he could use
and more. His army vastly outnumbered the remnant
of Lee's. His equipment was as perfect as
good organization and a lavish expenditure of money
could make it. With an unseen railroad skirting his
rear and a fleet at his base he could concentrate as
heavy a force as he pleased at any point he might
select on Lee's line. Moreover the extension of the
Federal line to the left had placed the two armies in
such position that if Grant could crush or break
through Lee's right wing, Richmond would be completely
cut off, and the successful retreat of Lee's
army would be impossible.</p>

<p>It was Grant's plan to do precisely this. To that
end he sent three strong divisions under General Ord
to strengthen his extreme left, where General Sheridan
commanded. Then he ordered Sheridan to push
forward through Dinwiddie Court House to Five
Forks and assail the enemy there.</p>

<p>Battle was joined on the thirty-first of March, but
so great was the resisting power of the sadly depleted
Confederate army, that Sheridan was hurled back
and compelled to appeal to Grant for help. On the
first of April, strongly reinforced, Sheridan again
advanced to the attack, and after a bloody contest
succeeded in carrying the position, taking about 5,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
prisoners, the very flower of the Confederate troops.</p>

<p>The work of ending the war was now on, and
Grant prosecuted it vigorously. At daybreak on
April the second he assaulted the center of Lee's line
near Petersburg, broke through it at two points, and
by pressing Lee hard on his right made a practical
end of Confederate resistance in that quarter.</p>

<p>There was nothing left to Lee but to abandon
Richmond and Petersburg and go into a retreat
which was sure to be marked at every step by fierce
fighting, but which was clearly hopeless from its
beginning. His only chance was to fall back through
Virginia, place himself behind the Roanoke river,
form a junction there with Johnston's army and
make one last, desperate stand against armies overwhelmingly
superior to his own in all except courage
and dogged determination. That chance was so
slender, by reason of the situation, that only a high
heroism would have regarded it even as a possibility.</p>

<p>Under Lee's instruction Richmond was evacuated.
In the process some fool poured all the alcoholic
liquor there was in the town into the gutters, at a
time when the arsenals and public warehouses were
being fired. The fire, of course, quickly set the
rivers of whiskey aflame and from these the houses
were ignited, so that within a brief while the entire
heart of the city was burned.</p>

<p>Lee's only hope in retreat lay in marching south-westwardly.
But Grant's forces under Sheridan had
the advantage of him at the start and their activity
was such as to keep them constantly not only upon
the left flank of the retreating forces, but also in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
front of them at many points. From beginning to
end of the retreat Grant hammered Lee's southern
flank, turned and assailed his front, and continuously
pressed him back toward James river on the north.
That way there lay no thoroughfare for the Confederates.
They must force their way to the southwest
or they must surrender for lack of food. They
simply could not force their way to the southwest, and
so their surrender was inevitable from the very first
hour of the retreat.</p>

<p>Moreover Lee's force, already depleted to a mere
handful, was hourly losing strength in many ways.
The constant fighting was depleting it. Starvation&mdash;not
figurative but actual&mdash;was compelling many of
the men to wander away from the line of march in
search of food. Many filled their bellies with grass
or leaves and marched on, determined to hold out to
the end. Here and there one got possession of an
ear of hard corn and accepted it as a three days' ration.
Pasture fields in which wild onions had sprung
up in response to the spring sunshine, were despoiled
of their fruitage by famishing men. The bursting
buds of forest trees were greedily eaten. Even haystacks&mdash;when
they were infrequently found&mdash;were
devoured as human food for lack of anything better.</p>

<p>All these things and others like unto them, were
done by the steadily diminishing company of Confederates
who were determined to hold out to the end
even if the end should prove to be death by starvation.
But hour by hour that small company of heroic souls
was growing smaller and smaller. Many died by the
roadside. Many were killed while delivering their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
own despairing fire. Many, seeing that further resistance
was hopeless, and knowing how terribly their
wives and children needed them in the homes which a
farther march would leave behind, simply went home.</p>

<p>During the last days of his retreat Lee had at no
time so many as 20,000 men, all starving, while his
adversary was assailing him by day and by night, with
a force numbering 150,000, or about eight to one.
Surely even the story of the Confederate war presents
no spectacle which better illustrates the high
quality of American manhood than does this resistance
through many days of starvation and discouragement,
by a mere handful of men, assailed in flank,
in rear and in front by seven or eight times their
number of perfectly equipped and well fed men.</p>

<p>At Appomattox Court House Lee found himself
completely surrounded. By good marching Grant
had succeeded in pushing an infantry column of
80,000 men into Lee's front, in support of Sheridan's
cavalry operations there.</p>

<p>There was only one course open to the great Confederate
chieftain. He surrendered on the ninth and
tenth of April all that remained of the Army of
Northern Virginia. They numbered, all told, including
teamsters, quartermaster's men and all, only
26,000 men, of whom no more than 7,800 carried
muskets.</p>

<p>In effect this surrender made an end of the most
stupendous war of modern times. As the army under
Lee had been from the beginning the backbone
of the Confederate cause, its destruction resulted in
the surrender of all the other Confederate forces as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
soon as the news of the event at Appomattox could
reach the detached commanders.</p>

<p>Here ends the story of the Confederate war. In
these pages a conscientious effort has been made to
tell it with the utmost impartiality and the most
scrupulous regard for truth.</p>

<p>That war began about forty-nine years ago. It is
now forty-five years since it ended in the restoration
of the American Union. The American people
are again completely one, and the great Republic has
come to be the most potent as it is the freest nation
that has ever existed on earth. The bitternesses and
resentments to which the fierce struggle gave birth
have been displaced by kindlier thoughts in all but the
narrowest and most ungenerous minds. The two
great commanders, Lee and Grant, have alike been
assigned to honored places in all our Halls of Fame.
The time has come when all Americans may fitly rejoice
together in the story of the great deeds done
on the one side and on the other in that Confederate
war which did so much to give to the Republic its
foremost place among the nations of the earth.</p>

<p>Punctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made consistent when a predominant
preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.</p>

<p>Simple typographical errors were corrected; occasional unpaired
quotation marks were retained except as noted below.</p>

<p>Ambiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained.</p>

<p>Text uses both "Haines Bluff" and "Haines's Bluff".</p>

<p>Text uses both "DuPont" and "Du Pont" when referring to the same
Rear-Admiral.</p>

<p>Some interrogative sentences ended with periods instead of with
question marks; retained here.</p>

<p>Text uses both "Alatoona" and "Allatoona".</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_88">88</a>: "wofully" was printed that way.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_104">104</a>: Missing closing quotation mark added after
'ill-looking.'</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_130">130</a>: "been able to oppose no obstacle" was printed that way.</p>

<p>Pages <a href="#Page_210">210&ndash;215</a>: opening quotation mark removed from General
Grant's quotation, because there were no other quotation marks
in the rest of that text.</p>

<p>Some out-of-sequence entries in the Index have been remedied, but
others may remain. Page references in the Index were not checked
for accuracy.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_365">365</a>: "succeeded by Halleck as commander Federal army" (under
McClellan) likely is missing the word "of".</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_368">368</a>: "divided by secession of West Virginia, vol. I, 259&ndash;60"
was missing the volume and page numbers.  They were added by
Transcribers based on examination of volume I of this set of books.</p>

<p>Several formats of Volume I of this set are available at no charge from Project Gutenberg:<br />
